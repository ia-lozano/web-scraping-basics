,The pestilence in my day was much worse than now.,Whole villages of empty houses,You could look outdoors and see Death,walking in the morning...,...dew dampening the ragged hem of his black robe.,Plain as I see you now,- You died of the plague,- The spotty monster,- Like you, alone,- I'm not alone,- You have no wife, no children,- I'm gay,So? Be gay, dance in your altogether for all I care,,what's that to do with not having children?,Gay homosexual, not bonny, blithe and"",Never mind,I had twelve.

,The Messenger comes. Prepare the way.,The infinite descent, a breath in air,They chose us, I suspect,,because of the mortal affinities,In a family as long-descended as the Walters,there are bound to be a few carried off by plague,- The spotty monster,- Black Jack,Came from a water pump, half the city of London,,can you imagine? His me from fleas,Yours, I understand,,is the lamentable consequence of venery,Fleas on rats, but who knew that?,- Am I going to die?,- We aren't allowed to discuss,When you do,,you don't get ancestors to help you through it,You may be surrounded by children,but you die alone,- I'm afraid,- You should be,There aren't even torches,,and the path's rocky, dark and steep,Don't alarm him.,There's good news before there's bad,We two come to strew rose petal and palm leaf,before the triumphal procession,Prophet. Seer. Revelator,- It's a great honor for the family,- He hasn't got a family,I meant for the Walters,,for the family in the larger sense,All I want is a room somewhere,,Far away from the cold night air...,Calm, calm, this is no brain fever,Even now, from the mirror-bright halls of Heaven,,across the cold and lifeless infinity of space...,...the Messenger comes trailing orbs of light,,fabulous, incipient, 0 Prophet, to you,Prepare, prepare, the infinite descent,A breath, a feather, glory to...,Why has democracy succeeded in America?,Of course by succeeded...,...I mean comparatively, not literally, not in the present,but what makes for the prospect...,...of some sort of radical democracy,spreading outward and growing up?,Why does the power that was once so carefully,preserved at the top of the pyramid...,...by the original framers of the Constitution,seem drawn inexorably downward and outward...,...in spite of the best efforts,of the Right to stop this?,I mean it's the really hard thing,about being Left in this country,The American Left can't help but trip over,all these petrified little fetishes,Freedom, that's the worst, you know. Jeane Kirkpauidx,for God's sake will go on and on about freedom...,...and so what does that mean, the word 'freedom',,when she talks about it, or human rights?,You got Bush talking about human rights,,and so what are these people talking about?,They might as well be talking,about the mating habits of Venusians,These people don't begin to know what, ontologically,,freedom is, or human rights,Like they see these bourgeois property-based,Rights-of-Man-type fights...,...but tl1at's not enfranchisement. not democracy,,not what's implicit, what's potential within the idea...,...not the idea with blood in it,That's just liberalism, the worst kind of liberalism,,really, bourgeois tolerance,And what I think is that what AIDS shows us,is the limits of tolerance,That it's not enough to be tolerated,,because when the shh his the fan...,...you find out how much tolerance is worth,Nothing. And underneath all the tolerance,is intense, passionate hatred,Uh-huh,- Well don't you think that's hue?,- Uh-huh. It is,Power is the object, not being tolerated.,Fuck assimilation,But I mean in spite of all this the thing about America,,I think, is that ultimately...,...we're different from every other nation on earth,,in that, with people here of every race, we can't...,Ultimately what defines us isn't race, but politics.,Not like any European country...,...where there's an insurmountable fact of a kind,of racial, or ethnic, monopoly, or monolith,Like all Dutchmen, I mean Dutch people,,are well, Dutch,And the Jews of Europe were never Europeans, just,a small problem. Facing the monolith. But here...,...there are so many small problems, it's really just a,collection of small problems, the monolith is missing,Oh, I mean, of course I suppose there's the monolith,of White America. White Straight Male America,- Which is not unimpressive, even among monoliths,- Well, no,But when the race thing gets taken care of...,and I don't mean to minimalize how major it is,I mean I know it is, this is a really, really incredibly,racist country...,...but it's like, well, the British.,I mean, all these blue-eyed pink people,And it's just weird, you know,,I mean I'm not all that Jewish-looking,Or... well, maybe I am but, you know,,in New York, everyone is,Well, not everyone, but so many are, but so,But in England, in London I walk into bars,and I feel like Sid the Yid,You know I mean like Woody Allen in Annie Hall,,with the payess and the gabardine coal,Like never, never anywhere so much... I mean,,not actively despised, not like they're Germans...,...who I think are still terribly anti-Semitic,,and racist too, I mean black-racist,They pretend otherwise but, anyway,,in London, there's just...,And atone point I met this black gay guy,from Jamaica who talked with a lilt,Even though he said his family been living in London,since before the Civil War, the American one,And how the English never let him forget for a minute,that he wasn't blue-eyed and pink,And I said yeah, me too, these people,are anti-Semites and he said yeah,But the British Jews have the clothing business,all sewed up and blacks there can't get a foothold,And it was an incredibly awkward moment of just...,I mean here we were, in this bar that was gay,but it was a pub, you know,The beams and the plaster and those horrible,little, like, two-day-old fish-and-egg sandwiches,And just so British, so old, and I fell,,well, there's no way out of this,Because both of us are, right now, too much immersed,in this history, hope is dissolved...,...in the sheer age of this place, where race is what,counts and there's no real hope of change,It's the racial destiny of the Brits that matters to them,,not their political destiny, whereas in America...,- Here in America race doesn't count,- No, no, that's not...,- I mean you can't be hearing that,- I'm hearing a lot of different...,Look, race, yes, but ultimately race here,is a political question, fight?,Racists just try to use race here as a tool in,a political snuggle. It's not really about race,Like the spiritualists try to use that stuff, are you,enlightened, are you centered, channeled, whatever,This reaming out for a spiritual past,in a country where no indigenous spirits exist,Only the Indians, I mean Native Americans,,and we killed them off, so now there are no gods here,No ghosts and spirits in America, there are no angels,in America, no spiritual past, no racial past,There's only the political, and the decoys and the plays,to maneuver around the inescapable battle of politics,The shifting downwards and outwards,of political power to the people,Power to the People! Amen!,Oh my goodness! Will you look at the time, I gotta go,- Do you think this is racist or naive or something?,- Well it's certainly something,Look, I just remembered I have an appointment, so...,What? I mean I really don't want to, like,,speak from some position of privilege and...,I'm sitting here, thinking,,eventually he's got to run out of steam,So I let you rattle on and on saying about maybe,seven or eight things I find really offensive,- What?,- But I know you. Louis,And I know the guilt fueling this peculiar tirade is,obviously already swollen bigger than your hemorrhoids,- I don't have hemorrhoids.,- I hear different. May I finish?,- Yes, but I don't have hemorrhoids,- So finally, when I do get a word in...,- Prior told you. He's an asshole, he shouldn't have...,- You promised, Louis. Prior is not a subject,- You brought him up,- I brought up hemorrhoids,- So it's indirect. Passive-aggressive,- Unlike, I suppose...,...banging me over the head with your theory,that America doesn't have a race problem,- Oh be fair, I never said that,- Not exactly, but...,But it was close enough, because,if it'd been that blunt I'd've just walked out and...,- You deliberately misinterpreted! I...,- Stop interrupting! I haven't been able to...,- Just let me...,- No! What, talk?,You've been running your mouth nonstop,since I got here, yaddadda yaddadda blah blah blah,- Up the hill, down the hill, playing with your monolith,- Well, you could have joined in at any lime...,And, girlfriend, it is truly an awesome spectacle,but I got better things to do with my time...,...than sit here listening to this racist bullshit,just because I feel sorry for you that...,- I am not a racist!,- Oh come on,- So maybe I am a racist but...,- Oh I really hate that,It's no fun picking on you. Louis. You're so guilty,,it's like throwing darts at a glob of jello,There's no satisfying his, just quivering,,the darts just blop in and vanish,I just think,when you are discussing lines of oppression...,- ...it gets very complicated,- Oh is that a fact!,You know, we black drag queens have a rather,intimate knowledge of the complexity of the lines of...,- Ex-black drag queen,- Actually ex-ex,- You're doing drag again?,- I don't... Maybe. I don't have to tell you. Maybe,- I think it's sexist,- I didn't ask you,Well it is. The gay community, I think,,has to adopt the same attitude towards drag...,...as black women have to take,towards black women blues singers,Oh my, we are walking dangerous tonight,Well, it's all internalized oppression, right,,I mean the masochism, the stereotypes, the...,Louis, are you deliberately trying,to make me hate you?,- No, I...,- I mean, are you deliberately transforming yourself...,...into an arrogant, sexual-political,Stalinist-slash-racist flagwaving thug for my benefit?,- You know what I think?,- What?,- You hate me because I'm a Jew,- I'm leaving,- It's true,- You have no basis except your...,Louis, it's good to know you haven't changed.,You are still an honorary citizen of The Twilight Zone,And after your pale, pale white polemics,on behalf of racial insensitivity...,...you have a flaming fuck of a lot of nerve,calling me an anti-Semis. Now I really gotta go,- You called me Lou the Jew,- That was a joke,I didn't think it was funny. It was hostile,- It was three years ago,- So?,- You just called yourself Sid the Yid,- That's not the same thing,- Sid the Yid is different from Lou the Jew,- Yes,Some day you'll have to explain that to me,,but fight now...,You hate me because you hate black people,I do not.,But I do think most black people are anti-Semitic,'Most black people',- That's racist, Louis, and I think most Jews...,- Louis Farrakhan,- Ed Koch,- Jesse Jackson,- Jackson. Oh really, Louis, this is...,- Hymietown! Hymietown!,Louis, you voted for Jesse Jackson!,You send d1eolcs to the Rainbow Coalition,- I'm ambivalent. The checks bounced,- All your checks bounce, Louis,- You're ambivalent about everything,- What's that supposed to mean?,You may be dumber than shit,but I refuse to believe you can't figure it out. Try,I was never ambivalent about Prior.,I love him. I do. I really do,- Nobody said different,- Love and ambivalence are... Real love isn't ambivalent,'Real love isn't ambivalent',I'd swear that's a line from my favorite bestselling,paperback novel, In Love with the Night Mysterious,- Except I don't think you ever read it,- I never read it, no,You ought to. Instead of spending the rest of your life,trying to get through Democracy in America,It's about this white woman whose daddy,owns a plantation in the Deep South...,...in the years before the Civil War,,the American one, and her name is Margaret,And she's in love with her daddy's number-one slave,,and his name is Thaddeus,And she's married,but her white slave-owner husband has AIDS,Antebellum Insufficiently Developed Sexorgans,And there's a lot of hot stuff going down,when Margaret and Thaddeus...,...can catch a spare torrid ten under the cotton-picking,moon, and then of course the Yankees come,And they set the slaves free, and the slaves,string up old daddy, and so on. Historical fiction,Somewhere in there I recall Margaret and Thaddeus,find the time to discuss the nature of love,Her face is reflecting the flames of the burning,plantation... you know, the way white people do,And his black face is dark in the night. And she says,to him Thaddeus, real love isn't ever ambivalent',Thaddeus looks at her. He's contemplating her thesis,,and he isn't sure he agrees,- Treatment number four,- Pharmaceutical miracle.

That scared me and I didn't go to the,funeral today because he was an Irish Catholic...,...and it's probably open casket and I'm afraid of...,something, the bird TB or seeing him,So I guess I'm doing OK.,Except for of course I'm going nuts,We ran the toxoplasmosis series,and there's no indication...,I know, I know, but I feel like something terrifying,is on is way, you know,Like a missile from outer space, and it's plummeting,down towards the earth, and I'm ground zero, and...,I am generally known where I am known,as one cool, collected queen. And I am ruffled,There's really nothing to worry about,I think that shochen bamromim hamtzeh,menucho nechono Al kanfey haschino,- What?,- Everything's fine,Benaalos k'doshim ut'horim,kezohar horokeea mazhirim,Oh I don't understand what you're...,Es nishmas Prior sheholoch leolomoh,,baavur shenodvoo z'dokoh b'ad hazkoras nishmosoh...,- Why are you doing that!

,the media swarms me, they hand,me the check for 10 Gs,,and the media's all sticking,microphones in my face,,and they're like, ""So Gary,,tell us, how does it feel,""to be the greatest rock, paper,,scissors champion in the history,of the entire world ever?"",Awesome, Timbuktu.,Awesome.,To say it simply,,I'd say know your opponent.,Uh, it's about being able,to profile another player,very, very quickly.,Um, and that means you need play,against a lot of different people.,Uh, nobody can practice by,playing against the same group,of people over and over and over again.,You're just not gonna get,anywhere, because you don't know,who you're gonna be pitted up against - it's,a randomized positioning at most tournaments.,Uh, so, you know, you might be put,up against the Norwegian champion,,or you might be put against,somebody just off the street.,Your ability to spot that,and spot what that person's,tells are right away,,uh, is really the hallmark,of a good player.,So, as you may or may not be aware,,Doug and Graham Walker, the,founders of the RPS Tournament,,wrote a book called...,The Official Rock, Paper,,Scissors Strategy Guide.,And don't get us wrong,,the book is amazing.,- Superb, really.,- Yes.,But when Holly and I,were going through it,,we noticed that there was,some stuff that was missing.,So...,Tada!,- We wrote our very own book.,""The Way of the Tosser,,""by Gary and Holly Brewer,,no relation."" - Yet.,- Exactly.,Well, we put in some really,neat strategies and stuff.,And yeah, a lot of,stuff like, for example,,nobody ever talks about,the importance of wrist work.,But when you think about it, the,wrist is what attaches your hand,to your arm, or ""jambre."",So we dedicated a whole,section to the wrist workouts.,Yeah, we did a lot of stuff, and we were,actually thinking about putting a section in it,that had some sort of, like, spring contraption,,and it could open up to a wrist workout -,so you'd actually be,getting a wrist workout,as you were opening up the wrist workout.,It's a double entendre.,Yeah. And there'd be lots of,pop-outs - like this, for example.,- Scissors. Holly made that.,- That's scissors.,We're gonna have pop-outs,all through it, too.,And, um, read the quote,at the first... - Oh yeah.,This is... I tried to,dictate it, but Holly wrote it,'cause she's much,better at that than I am.,""The way of the tosser:,""the conviction and continuous compulsion,to toss against everything and,anything at any given time."",That's me.,I'm a tosser.,I use alliterations.,I don't even know what to say.,I'm constantly tossing.,I toss in the shower,,I toss when I wake up, I toss when I'm reading,the paper, I'd toss if I was walking a dog,,or if I was in a cemetery,or a cell block or something -,I would toss all the time.,I mean, I toss against friends or foe.,I mean, it doesn't even,matter if Holly's around.,It's true. I catch Gary tossing,all the time - even behind my back.,Sometimes we'll be having,a serious discussion,,and I look over at him -,there he is, just tossing away.,I think I might have a problem.,♪ I toss, I turn,♪ We toss in turn,We wrote that a year after,our first-year anniversary.,- Yep.,- Remember the night we met?,- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.,- He was wearing this black Maiden shirt.,Yep. And you were wearing,a really nice red thing.,- I think you mean my shirt.,- Yeah, yeah, your shirt.,Oh, that was blue.,It was blue.,- That's what I meant.,That's what I meant.,Gary found me sitting in a,ditch singing Silent Night,,like in the First World War.,The official theory of,the World RPS Society is that,it dates to around,the 18th century, in Japan,,where it's know as jankenor janken-pon,,uh, depending on where you're from.,It's been documented,through cave drawings,and pottery-making that,the early homo sapiens,used a form of rock, paper, scissors -,except they used club...,stone, and fire.,So I used to sell hubcaps,on the side of the road.,And this one morning, I show up,to work and there's this guy,slumped and slouched against,all my 1976 Pinto caps.,The little puny guy was Trevor.,Yeah, and he was dressed up,in this weird, like, military outfit,,all, like, ripped up, and he,had a giant helmet with these,weird tinfoil antenna things on it,,and he was, like, totally spaced out.,And I was like,,""Hey, man. How are you?"",And he was like, ""Ah..."",Like, he was singing and stuff.,Oh Trevor, I can just,imagine you squished up there -,like, ""Trevor phone home,"",eating Reese's Pieces and stuff.,Ooh! Priceless.,So anyway, it turns out,he was totally anemic.,It turns out he was totally amnesiac.,He had ""amne-zee-ah."",Remember?,No.,I do.,We presume they were thrown...,like this.,I eventually remembered,my name and stuff,,but I still can't remember where,I'm from or who my parents are.,Or to put the toilet seat down.,Yeah.,That too.,Club could bat stone,,and stone could put out the fire,,and, of course,,a fire can burn the club - whoosh!,Yes.,The game has deep roots.,So, Holly's parents were out of town,,and Trevor and me were like,,""Hey Hol, can we borrow,your VW camper van?"",'Cause her parents had a really nice,one, and we really wanted to borrow it.,And Holly was like,,""Yeah, sure. No problem."",- You were gonna cup-a-fart me.,- No, I wasn't.,What's a cup-a-fart?,It's when you cup your hand,,and then you fart in it,,and then you can throw,it in someone's face.,Gary was gonna fart in my face.,Anyways, the point is,,we got the VW camper van, and,we headed down to the sand pits.,And, uh,,yeah, the tire fire was huge.,And there was tons,of people there drinking,and throwing tons of tires,and stuff on the fire.,And we didn't have any tires,,so what we brought was hubcaps -,'cause I had lots of hubcaps -,and we were flinging those,on there, and we were, like,,playing with the hubcaps and stuff.,- Playing Frisbee.,- Yeah.,Um, but then, long story short,,um, I was going for a long bomb,over the fire.,And Trevor was throwing it to me,,and he tried to put too much,power on it with his hand,,and he overcompensated, and,he flung it right to his side.,And he hit a chick in the face with the hubcap.,- Knocked out all of her teeth.,One of her teeth hit me in the chinbone.,So of course, the guys she's with,immediately start trying to jump Trevor,,and then they start trying to jack,all the tires off the VW camper van.,So, you know, I had to get in there, and I had,to start trying to kick some ass, you know?,- Which was so stupid.,- Yeah, but...,how was I supposed to know,the entire team was there?,They punched his nuts a lot.,They had my legs open,in this giant flying V,,and they kept doing this,,like, rat-a-tat-tat thing,,and it was, like, flapping a lot.,Luckily, the first guy,kicked them right up and in,,so basically they were,just kicking empty sacks.,Yeah, that's really, really,good, because then it was just,like sack punishment -,it was more like a...,But, um, the point is,,after they were done,with all the... puh!,After they were done with,all the sack punishment,,they picked me up and they,threw me in the bushes,,and I landed on top of,,um, this drunken bum,,who turned out to be none other,than the rock, paper, scissors legend...,Finnegan O'Reilly.,And, just like that, my,life had changed forever.,But it did take 2 weeks,for the second one to drop.,So I got really worried, and,I got Gary to jump up and down,on one leg, and I would pat them a lot.,- Yeah.,- It was a pretty scary time.,And now it's, um, it's sort,of squarish, on the bottom.,It's so gross.,Yeah.,I took Gary on as a goddamn pupil.,Stupid punk landed right on top of me.,Blathering like a goddamn baby, he was.,He got beer all over me.,I was trying to sleep, goddamnit!,Finnegan immediately taught me,that fighting doesn't solve anything,,but RPS is definitive,and ""unargabubble."",Unarguable.,So basically,,now he tosses before he punches.,Non-violence.,Which makes me really happy.,Me too. It's really...,safe.,I first got into photography,'cause I wanted to take,a picture of the air,at the exact right time when I,would get a visual confirmation,of the invisible ghost that,haunted me through my childhood.,Finnegan was the first official,player to get an RPS trading card.,And when Gary wins the championship,he's gonna get his very own card.,Oh, definitely.,So this stuff is sort of like my arsenal,- just some things I keep in my room.,Helps me, you know, clear-cut through all,the fake emotional stuff,that lives up in the old ticker,,and as well I can use it for good-luck,sacrifices, that sort of thing, when I have to.,First of all...,we have rock.,Rock is like the moon, except smaller.,And... there's no dust on it.,And it doesn't smile,at you from miles away.,Next up, we have paper.,Paper. You see how my fingers,are really closely together,,and if I go like this, no air,passes through them whatsoever?,And this is really serious, too:,if your thumb's out like this,,you're out - finito bambino.,If you're like this, it's fine.,I really like paper,because it's smooth,and it's really sleek,,and basically, if you go sideways,,you're see-through.,Can you imagine being 2-D?,Last little ""knickknack paddy-,whack give-a-dog-a-bone"",is my personal favorite,,my power throw, my power item -,boom - scissors.,And let's make something clear here:,these two digitals, they're down.,Little green thumb? You're,not gardening. Stick it down.,You'll get disqualified - I'm,telling you, I've seen it happen.,And it's like this: the V, baby.,And it's like this:,uno, dos, ""cinqs."",Gary's a goddamned idiot.,Gary is spot-on.,You can only imagine how excited we were,when we found out we,were living next door,to a famous sports celebrity.,Okay, here we go:,the chump factor.,Basically, the chump factor,is a factor that explains,the suckiness of people with RPS,,and how these sucky people still win.,It's like a whole out-of-sync thing.,It's like, if I'm tossing like,that, they're tossing like this,,or they're tossing like that,,or they're tossing like...,like, they'll throw it,too much or something.,This is a photo of Gary,when he's really, really angry.,As you can see,,he's probably just lost to a chump.,The person that embodies the,chump factor to the chumpth degree -,like, chump thousand and 20 -,is Baxter Pound.,He is the ultimate...,of all chumps.,I'm so excited about this whole,documentary thing we got going here.,I'm actually a huge doc fan.,Um, I saw...,March of the Penguins. Yeah?,You know that? So...,I saw it in the theatre, so...,Huge fa... Oh! Madelena.,I'm just gonna stop by.,I always have,my 'dogs here. Hello.,He basically looks like,a really happy skinny elf,,with a big head and a small body.,Mmm!,Mhm.,That's really fantastic.,Thank you.,- So Baxter has his own card, you know.,- What?,- Yeah, he gave it to me. You wanna see it?,- No.,Yeah, it's a pretty big deal.,But, I mean...,Who can argue with,stats like that, right?,He looks sort of funny.,This is really professional.,I have this Polaroid,sequence I'm working on,where this one drives,a Ferrari all around,the Isle of Corfu, Italy.,Where are they going?,To a hotel.,I don't have the hotel yet, though.,It costs, like, 3 times,as much as the Ferrari.,Gotta be careful, 'cause, you know...,Holly. It's okay, though.,I got a key.,Even just looking at them,gives me the heebie-jeebies.,Ha!,Whoa, eh?,Check these suckers out.,Total good luck and good karma.,I suffer from what is,called sicosnipophobia -,the fear of scissors.,I used to use them,to cut my dog Rufus' hair.,He was a Newfoundland wolf dog.,Rufus had incredible form.,He used to lift up his paw and wag it,right in front of your face.,And Gary taught him some really,incredible intimidation tactics.,So this one time,,Trevor and Rufus,were tossing for shotgun.,The only barrier to rock,,paper, scissors is really having,a minimum of 3 fingers on one hand:,as long as you fit those,requirements, then theoretically,you carry everything you need,to play rock, paper, scissors.,And I told Rufus to throw a paper.,And he got Trevor on a late rock.,So Rufus hopped up in the cab of the truck,,and we went off, and Trevor was in the back.,I used to lift up his ears,and flap them up and down,so he looked like a flying dog.,And I'd say, ""Watch out for,the incredible 'taw posser!'"",I mean... ""paw tosser."",He really loved that.,We got sideswiped by a cement truck.,Passenger side was totaled,,and Rufus died on impact.,This is Rufus before the accident.,This is Rufus after the accident.,Ugh!,I haven't...,thrown paper since, you know.,Just out of respect.,After the goddamn dog died,,Gary refused to throw paper.,You know, training a guy,who refused to throw paper,,it's like...,training a retard to tap dance.,As soon as Gary wins, we're,gonna find a really special place,to spread Rufus' ashes, to thank,him for his supernatural guidance,,and also to thank him for not,taking over Gary's body in revenge.,Yeah.,Gary, have you seen the plunger?,Oh! Sorry! Holly, I'm sorry.,I should have put the sign up.,We have a sign. I'm sorry!,The Rufus shears are the,only scissors in the house.,Yep.,- Well, how do you cut things?,Oh...,An X-Acto knife.,Next thing I know,,this guy's whizzing to other dimensions.,""The zone."",This is our mental preparation.,Okay, everybody has to be really quiet,,'cause the slightest sound,will knock him right out of it.,It's sort of like a transcendence.,Yeah, it's like a lucid cosmic journey,where I enter a whole new land,,and it's full of pyramids,and deserts and, like,,bleeding cubes in the sky.,And he sometimes talks in tongues,,but without using his tongue.,Skills.,It's like peyote, except natural.,Yeah. What I do,is I coax him into it.,I help him get deeper into the zone.,Oh, sorry.,We almost forgot the music.,Yes.,This music is from the,Paranormal Society of Ontario.,Are you ready?,- Wait.,Okay.,Shh.,Hello?,Hello? Hi.,Hey, Little S...,Hey, Little Stacey.,Yeah, um...,Okay, well, why don't,we meet in the backyard?,Perfect. Yeah,,I'll be there in, uh...,10 minutes?,- Ow.,- Yeah, it's good for me.,Okay, bye.,I forgot to unplug the phone.,I saw your great-grandmother,riding a giant praying mantis.,- Again?,- Yeah. She says hi.,- You landed on my head.,- I'm really sorry.,Use your mind,to read my mind.,Uh... paper?,Read my thoughts.,Scissors.,Know my soul.,Rock.,Yes.,Good for you.,Sometimes I space out and I'll, like,,randomly toss right,in front of Little Stacey.,And I'm like, ""Gary,,that's your student."",I know, I know.,And I'm like, ""Oops."",Like, the other day, I had Little Stacey,all blindfolded up, and then I caught myself,totally just tossing right in her face.,I'm like, ""Yeah, I wish,you would toss in my face."",Now, what would you most like to be?,A rock, a paper, or a scissors?,You first, dear.,No, you go ahead.,No, no, no.,Women and ladies first.,Sweetheart.,Um...,A rock...,- Paper! I wanna be paper.,I wasn't choosing.,I was just...,A rock, paper, or scissors.,- You asked her to choose, and she chose: she chose rock.,I chose paper.,Paper covers rock. I won.,I wasn't choosing, honey. I was asking,him what the options were all over again.,He asked your choice, and you said what you,wanted to say, and I said what I wanted to say,,and if this was a real,competition, I would win.,Scissors.,She can't pick scissors,after she picked rock.,Real player. Crappy player.,Legend. Chump.,- That's my card.,- Oh yeah?,Yeah.,- That's nice.,- Yeah, that's me: Baxter Pound.,- That's nice.,- Yeah. That's for you.,- Thank you.,- You're very welcome.,You know what?,Wait right here.,Wait right here.,Be right back. One sec!,Uh, it's not necessarily,about being the best player,,which many people often think it is.,It's often about handling the pressure.,- Oh!,Not so tough now, are you,,Baxter boy, huh?,You and your little stupid card.,You're not so tough,now, Mr. Chumper,,The Chump... the Chump-Man.,Me and Rufus are snipping you up.,Fine grade, fine grade, fine grade.,Paper snipper, paper snipper.,Snipping up, snipping up. Yeah.,You know, the most common,thing that you'll hear,people saying is that,random is the best strategy.,And that's actually,a big load of nonsense,,because humans are actually,terrible at playing randomly.,Chance has nothing,to do with it. Nothing.,It's been proven that the,likelihood of 2 people tossing,the same series of tosses,in a consecutive timeframe,is less than 15%, 97% of the time.,If both players are randomizing,,then you're gonna win 1/3, lose,1/3, and tie 1/3 of the time.,And really, that's not very strategic.,It's basically the theory of numbers 3.,It's a magical number,,like our trio.,This is gonna be a good one.,Yeah, Rufus used to run away,for, like, days at a time.,He'd go and he'd roll around,in a bunch of cow patties,and dead fish and stuff -,he loved doing that.,- It was his perfume.,- Yeah, it was his cologne.,- He had a really small tail.,- You know what this is?,Documentation of fallopian infertility.,Hmm?,Wrote that myself.,Did it at work.,- The flotation thingy?,- No. No, Lloyd says that, but it's not Linda, it's Lloyd.,It has to do with his soldiers.,You know, the slimy ones?,Oh yeah, it's the sperm-shooting thing.,Ew. Gary, you did not,just say that on camera.,I'm really sorry.,My blanks are fully loaded.,Well, I heard one time,that there was this couple,that had the same problem,,and what they did is they tried,this, like, Eastern,mysticism, uh, type of stuff.,And what happened is it depended on,which way they faced when they did it.,Gary.,Well, I mean, it's not just that.,I mean, it was like the whole,,like, feng shui type of thing -,like yin yang feng shui...,type of thing.,Anyway...,- That's so bad.,Yeah, well, I heard they had triplets.,Oh, my God, that's so cute.,Yeah. It's miraculous.,This amulet protects me,from the ghost of Rufus.,Sometimes, I wake up,in the middle of the night,,and he's sitting on the end of my bed.,I know how much the,ashes mean to Gary, though.,So I don't say anything.,♪ I toss for fun,♪ I toss for love,♪ I toss just because,I have to ♪,- Oh, I loves y'all.,- I love ya.,I love you.,I love you.,- I love ya.,- I love ya.,- Loves y'all. - I love ya.,- I love you.,Oh, I like this one.,What is that? A bird?,It's your coffee mug.,Oh. I really like it.,It's a mug!,Do you wanna know,why I don't compete anymore?,One year, I was really close,to making the qualifier,to the championships.,I threw paper.,My opponent threw scissors.,He snipped me.,That's just bad sportsmanship.,You can't snip. It's like,throwing it in your face.,Now I can't compete anymore.,And that's why I hate scissors.,So I just cheer Gary on.,Every serious tosser has a power toss.,If you don't, you are not a pro.,And I find it really interesting,,because a person's power toss,describes a lot about them -,like, you can really learn a lot about,a person by what their power toss is.,What does it say about you?,When you start playing it,with other people, you realize,that the game is actually much...,very secondary to the,gamesmanship of the game,,and that's basically how,you play your opponent.,Rock, paper, scissors is so crazy and,difficult 'cause it's different everywhere.,For example, in tournament play,,it's 1, 2, 3, toss,,whereas in street play,,it's 1, 2, and you toss on the third one.,So it, like, makes it totally different.,Like, here's an example:,here we go with the street toss.,No. Wait, what'd I...,Shit. Um, crap. Sorry.,Um, here we go with the...,I'll do a street toss for you.,1, 2, 3...,1, 2... See?,It's hard because you get confused.,I always do - 'cause I'm in,tournaments so much, maybe -,I always do the tournament stuff,first. But it's like 1, 2, boom.,There. See?,You see how hard that is?,I'm a pro. I'm a pro, and,I still get confused at this.,And then you got the tournament.,But that's just me showing off,a bit. I don't always do that.,But I got this one, too,,if you wanna show off.,That's the power pump.,The power pumper is different,,though: you can't use that.,You can't use that in street or anything,'cause it's like a pumping motion, like...,Like, that's ridiculous.,- Yeah! - Whoo!,- Yes!,Nice one, Trevor.,That's great.,Wow.,Basically, I invented a whole new style,of rock, paper, scissors,,which could reinvent, um,,a whole new game as we know it.,It's called ""karateoss."",I taught this one how to karateoss.,She's pretty much the,only one I could teach,,because she's the only one,with posable joints.,You see, rock, paper, scissors,is simple yet definitive.,Karate is forceful, yet it's non-violent.,And I wanted to create a name,that would embody both,these factors, you know?,Yeah. It's like Attack,Of the 50-foot Woman:,of course she's going to attack.,She feels uncomfortable with her surroundings.,- Exactly.,She can only throw paper.,And her form is pretty bad.,It would never pass,in a competition scenario.,But nobody's perfect, right?,I'll get it!,Hi, guys! Come on in.,Holly, love the hair.,- Thank you.,- You look lovely. Come on in.,Look who's here!,Look who's here!,My favorite day of the week,is Wednesday nights,,because every Wednesday night we,have a karaoke party at Lloyd and Linda's.,And this karaoke guy,comes and he hosts it.,Oh, I wonder who that could be.,Hey-hey!,Good evening, everyone, and,welcome to Lloyd and Linda's,Wednesday night karaoke,party extravaganza.,I see some familiar,faces out there tonight.,Holly, love the hair.,But for those of you that don't,know me, my name is Chris,,and I will be your host,for this evening's events.,Let's get this party started.,♪ When she was young,♪ She dreamed of meeting...,I do a lot of door-to-door work,,but Holly and Gary are the best.,It's like watching Lionel Richie,and Debbie Gibson rip it up -,finally.,I really love when Gary sings.,It reminds me of the first time we met.,♪ When I got home,The other day ♪,♪ I played against,A really good ♪,♪ Tosser,Yeah, give me that one.,♪ Skee-bop!,One more time. Ready? And...,♪ Skee-bop!,♪ Skee-bop!,Yeah.,♪ If I were,♪ A celebrity,♪ I would do everything,♪ Just wait and see,♪ If I was,♪ A celebrity,♪ I...,Yeah!,Oh no, I never mix,business with pleasure.,You know, for me,,RPS and tossing is a serious thing.,Boom!,Tossing dynamite,against a very serious player,is basically like tossing,a big plopper on a priest.,It's not cool.,You know, if something,ever happened with that,,I'd probably just take it cool.,Dropped dynamite right on my,food! You're a horrible man!,You're a horrible man!,Who are you?!,- Shh.,Who are you?!,I can't breathe!,I can't breathe!,I can't breathe.,I can't breathe.,I can't breathe!,I'm hyperventilating.,♪ I wake up with,A little light on my face ♪,♪ I look on over,As you lie in your place ♪,♪ The air is cool,And we don't say a word... ♪,- Hey, Trev.,- Hey, guys.,How you feeling, sleepy head?,I woke up with no clothes on,and a peanut butter,cookie stuck to my forehead.,I took some really,strange photos of myself.,Here, let me see them.,Oh, that one looks,like a bird. Nice.,I don't know what part of me that is.,Sort of looks like the back of your knee.,You know, I was thinking about,it, and I don't know one time,where it's legit to throw dynamite.,Ever.,Gary's just too good for his own good.,Yeah. I knew this guy,was coming with rock,,but I don't throw paper -,'cause I can't throw paper...,You have to throw paper, goddamnit.,You only have 3 to choose from.,So, you know, my head's saying one thing,,my heart's saying another thing,,and we go coo, coo, coo, conk,,and I toss both at the same time.,""The shocker."",It shocked me.,Yeah. I totally,shocked myself.,And, you know, I just hate that part, because,all of a sudden now the names start...,Yeah, it's so vindictive.,""Shocks,"" ""Shiggety Shocktail,"",""Shocker Mahoney,"",""Shocker McGillicuddy,"",""The Great White Shock,"",""The Yes Man..."",Yeah. There's plenty,more where they came from.,Gets stuck in here,,and you're done like your goddamn dinner.,No, I haven't seen,Finnegan in almost 6 months.,But basically you still do, right?,Well, yeah... As he puts it,,I'm in a phase of my training,where I have to, ""go on my goddamn own,and find my,own goddamn way."",Gary's not even allowed,to call him anymore.,- No. - Nothing.,- No. It's really serious stuff.,Yeah, I gave up on Gary.,What was I supposed to do?,I left the world of RPS a long time ago.,Between you and me, what's,happening in the sport today,is a goddamn mockery.,I should have taken,that night at the tire fire,for what it was:,goddamn meaningless.,I still have this.,His playing card.,He looks like an eggplant with a unibrow.,""Uniplant."",Taking on Gary was a,careless drunken mistake.,I know he only wants the best for me.,Did you know Gary's competing,in the world championships?,This is the helmet I was wearing,when Gary found me.,Can you hear them now?,Nope.,How about now?,Nope.,Anything?,Sort of.,Okay, Little Stacey.,Today I have a bit of,a challenge for you:,you're gonna have a one-off,,no-holds-barred street match,against an opponent that,uses intimidation tactics.,- Okay.,- Okay?,He's gonna be really big,,he's gonna be really scary,,and he's really gonna be,in your face and stuff,,but I don't want you to get too,overwhelmed and scared, okay?,But if you do, and if you feel like,you're gonna be swallowed,by a pit of scaredness,,I just want you to yell,our magic code word,,and I'll make him disappear -,what's our code word?,- ""Tosser."",- That's my girl. Get ready.,DARRYL!!!,Okay, I don't want you letting this,chump get in your face, Little Stacey.,- I'll eat you, Little Stacey!,- Poo on you!,Okay, I want this clean,,I want it legit. On 3.,Ready?

I feel like shit but I've never felt more alive,I've finally found the secret of all that Mormon energy,Devastation. That's what makes people migrate, build things,Devastated people do it, people who have lost love,Because I don't think God loves His people any more than Joe loved me,The string was cut. and off they went.

You were the first to come to mind - What do you mean you needed a Jew?,- We're going to thank him. For the pills. - Thank him?,What do you call the Jewish prayer for the dead?,- The Kaddish - That's the one. Hit it,Whoah. hold on,- Do it. do it. they'll be in here to check and he... - I'm not. Fuck no,For him? No fucking way! The drugs OK, sure, fine,But no fucking way am I praying for him. My New Deal Pinko parents in Schenectady...,...would never forgive me. they're already so disappointed,'He's a fag, he's an office temp, and now look, he's saying Kaddish for Roy Cohn',- I can't believe you'd actually pray for... - Louis. I'd even pray for you,He was a terrible person. He died a hard death. So maybe a queen can forgive her vanquished foe,It isn't easy. it doesn't count if it's easy. It's the hardest thing. Forgiveness,Which is maybe where love and justice finally meet,Peace. at least. Isn't that what the Kaddish asks for?,Oh it's Hebrew or Aramaic or something, who knows what it's asking,I'm thirty-two years old and I've never seen a dead body before,It's so heavy, and small,I know probably less of the Kaddish than you do.

Where were you?,- A trip to the moon on gossamer wings - What?,You ought to get your hearing checked. you say that a lot,I was out. With a friend. In Paradise,In the Hall of the Continental Principalities. Heaven. a city much like San Francisco,Six of seven myriad infinite aggregate angelic entities in attendance,May their glorious names be praised for ever and ever, Hallelujah,Permanent Emergency Council is now in session,...one week following the explosion at the number four reactor. the fires are still burning and an estimated...,...releasing into the atmosphere fifty million curies of radioactive iodine...,...falling like toxic snow into the Dnieper River. which provides drinking water for thirty-five million...,...consequence of the lack of safety culture caused by Cold War isolation,- When? - April 26. Three months from today,- Where is this place? This reactor? - Chernoby. In Belarus,We are losing the signal,- Hundreds, thousands will die - Horribly. Hundreds of thousands,- Let them. Uncountable multitudes. Horrible,- It is by their own hands. I I I will rejoice to see it - That is forbidden us. Silence in heaven,The reception is too weakl,- Can it be fixed? - It is beyond us,I I I do not weep for them. I I I weep for the irremediable wastage of fossil fuels,Old blood of the globe spilled wantonly or burned and jettisoned into the crystal air,If only he would return and explain to us,Most august fellow principalities. angels most high. I regret my absence. I was detained,- Ah, this is...? - The Prophet. Yes,I want to return thisI,- What is the matter with it? - lt just...,We can't just stop. We're not rocks,Progress. migration. motion is modernity. It's animate. it's what living things do,We desire. Even if all we desire is stillness, it's still desire for,Even if we go faster than we should. We can't wait. And wait for what?,God?God?,He isn't coming back. And even if He did...,If He ever did come back...,If He ever dared to show His face, or his glyph or whatever in the garden again...,If after all this destrution, if after all the terrible days of this terrible century...,He returned to see how much suffering His abandonment had created...,if all He has to offer is death You should sue the bastard,Sue the bastard for walking out. How dare He. He oughta pay,Thus spake the Prophet,So thank you for sharing this with me. but I don't want to keep it,- He wants to live - Yes,I'm thirty years old. for God sake,I haven't done anything yet. I want to be healthy again,And this plague, it should stop. In me and everywhere. Make it go away,We have tried. We suffer with you but we do not know. We do not know how,This is the tome of immobility. of respite. of cessation,Drink of its bitter water once. Prophet. and you will never thirst again,I can't,I still want my blessing. Even sick. I want to be alive,You only think you do. Life is a habit with you,You have not seen what is to come. We have,What will the grim unfolding of these latter days bring? That you or any being should wish to endure them?,Death more plenteous than all heaven has tears to mourn it,The slow dissolving of the great design. the spiraling apart of the work of eternity,The world and its beautiful particle logic all collapsed,All dead, forever, in starless, moon-Iorn onyx night,We are failing, failing, the earth and the angels. Look up, look up,It is not-to-be time,Oh, who asks of the orders blessing with apocalypse descending?,Who demands more life? When death like a protector...,...blinds our eyes shielding from tender nerve more horror than can be borne?,Let any being on whom fortune smiles creep away to death,Before that last dreadful daybreak，When all your ravaging returns to you"".,With the rising. scorching. unrelenting sun：,When morning blisters crimson and bears all life away,A tidal wave of protean fire that curls around the planet,And bares the earth clean as bone,But still. Still... Bless me anyway,I want more life. I can't help myself. I do,I've lived through such terrible times. and there are people who live through much much worse,But you see them living anyway,When they're more spirit than body. more sores than skin...,...when they're burned and in agony. when flies lay eggs in the corners of the eyes of their children, they live.,Death usually has to take life away. I don't know if that`s just the animal,I don't know if it's not braver to die. but I recognize the habit,The addiction to being alive. We live past hope,lf l can find hope anywhere. that's it. that's the best I can do. That's so much not enough.,so inadequate,But bless me anyway. I want more Iife,You haven't seen what's to come. You've only seen what you're afraid is coming,Until it arrives please don't be offended. but all you can see is fear,I'm leaving heaven to you now. I'll take my illness with me,And I'll take my death with me. too,The earth's my home, and I want to go home,- I'm exhausted - You've been working hard,- I feel terrible - Welcome back to the world,From where.,- Well look at this. It's the dawn of man - Venus rising from the sea,- I'm wet- Fever broke. That's a good sign,- They'll be in to change you in... - Mrs Pitt? Did she...,Elle fait sa toilette. Elle est tres formidable, ca. where did you find her?,We found each other. she... I've had a remarkable dream,And you were there. And you,- And you - I what?,And some of it was terrible. and some of it was wonderful,But all the same I kept saying I want to go home and they sent me home,- What are you talking about! - Thank you,- I just slept in the chair - She saved my life,I did no such thing. I slept in the chair. Being in hospital upsets me. it reminds me of things,I have to go home now. I had the most peculiar dream,Can I come in?,I have to start rounds,You're one of the lucky ones. I could give you a rose. You rest your weary bones,What are you... What happened to you?,Visible scars. You said...,Oh, Louis, you're so goddamned literal about everything,- I'm going now - You'll come back,if I can. I have things to take care of.,Please do. I have always depended on the kindness of strangers,Well, that's a stupid thing to do!,- Who's she? - You really don't want to know,- Before I depart. A homecoming gift - What?,I can't read the label. My eyes aren't any better,AZT? How on earth did you...? These are hot pills. I am shocked,A contribution to the get-well fund. From a bad fairy,These pills, they... They make you better,They're poison. they make you anemic. This is my life. from now on. Louis. I'm not getting better,l'm not sure I'm ready to do that to my bone marrow,We can talk about it tomorrow. I'm going home to nurse my grudges,Ta, baby, sleep all day,Ta, Louis, you sure know how to clear a room,Prior, I want to come back to you,I want the credit card. that's all,You can keep track of me from where the charges come from. if you want to keep track. I don't care,I have some things to tell you,I don't want to talk, we shouldn't do that anymore. Credit card,I don't know what will happen to me without you,Only you. Only you love me. Out of everyone in the world,I have done things, I'm ashamed. But I have changed. I don't know how. Please, please, don't leave me now, Harper,Harper，You are my good heart.,Did you hurt?,Yes. Remember that. PIease.,if I can get a job or something. I'll cut the card to pieces...,...and there won't be charges anymore.Credit Card.,Call or... Call. You have to,No. Probably never again. That's how bad,Sometimes, maybe lost is best,Get lost. Joe. Go exploring,With a big glass of water,I want to come back to you. You could respond. you could say something,Throw me out or say it's fine, or it's not fine, but sure what the hell or...,I really failed you. But... This is hard,Failing in love isn't the same as not loving. It doesn't let you off the hook,It doesn't mean you're free to not love,- I love you Louis - Good. I love you,I really do. But you can't come back,Not ever. I'm sorry. But you can't,Night flight to San Francisco. Chase the moon across America,God! It's been years since I was on a plane,When we hit thirty-five thousand feet. we'll have reached the tropopause,The great belt of calm air. As close as I'll ever get to the ozone,I dreamed we were there. The plane leap the tropopause, the safe air...,...and attained the outer rim, the ozone, which was ragged and torn,Patches of it threadbare as old cheesecloth. and that was frightening,But I saw something only I could see because of my astonishing ability to see such things,Souls were rising, from the earth far below, souls of the dead,Of people who had perished from famine, from war, from the plague,And they floated up, like skydivers in reverse, limbs all akimbo, wheeling and spinning,And these departed souls joined hands. clasped ankles. and formed a web,A great net of souls. and the souls were three-atom oxygen molecules. of the stuff of ozone,And the outer rim absorbed them. and was repaired,Longing for what we've left behind, and dreaming ahead,At least I think that's so.,EPILOGUE : Bethesda,The Berlin Wall has fallen. The Ceausescus are out. He's building democratic socialism,The New internationalism. Gorbachev is the greatest political thinker since Lenin,I don't think we know enough yet to start canonizing him. The Russians hate his guts,Yeah but remember back four years ago? The whole time we were feeling...,...everything everywhere was stuck. while in Russia... look! Perestroika. The Thaw,It's the end of the Cold War. The whole world is changing overnight,- I wonder what'll happen now in places like Yugoslavia - Yugoslavia?,Let's just turn the volume down on this. OK? They'll be at it for hours,It's not that what they're saying isn't important,,This is my favorite place in New York City. No. in the whole universe. The parts of it I have seen,On a day like today. A sunny winter's day. warm and cold all at once,The sky's a little hazy. so the sunlight has a physical presence. a character,In autumn. those trees across the lake are yellow. and the sun strikes those most brilliantly,Against the blue of the sky, that sad fall blue, those trees are more light than vegetation,They are Yankee trees, New England transplants. They're barren now,It's January 1990. I have been living with AIDS for five years,That's six whole months longer than i lived with Louis.,Whatever comes. what you have to admire in Gorbachev. in the Russians...,...is that they're making a leap into the unknown,You can't wait around for a theory. The sprawl of life. the weird...,- interconnectedness - Yes,Maybe the sheer size of the terrain,It's all too much to be encompassed by a single theory now,The world is faster than the mind,That's what politics is. The world moving ahead. And only in politics does the miraculous occur,But that's a theory,You can't live in the world without an idea of the world. but it's living that makes the ideas,You can't wait for a theory. but you have to have a theory,Go know. As my grandma would say,This angel. She's my favorite angel. I like them best when they're statuary,They commemorate death but they suggest a world without dying,They are made of the heaviest things on earth, stone and iron,They weigh tons but they're winged. they are engines and instruments of flight,This is the angel Bethesda. Louis will tell you her story,Oh. Well, she was this angel, she landed in the Temple Square in Jerusalem, in the days of the Second Temple,Right in the middle of a working day she descended and just her foot touched earth,And where it did, a fountain shot up from the ground,When the Romans destroyed the Temple, the fountain of Bethesda ran dry,And Belize will tell you about the nature of the fountain, before the flowing is stopped.,walked through the waters of the fountain of Bethesda...,...they would be healed, washed clean of pain,They know this because I've told them, many times. Hannah here told me this,- She also told me this - When the Millennium comes...,Not the year two thousand. but the capital M Millennium,Right. The fountain of Bethesda will flow again,And I told him I would personally take him there to bathe. We will all bathe ourselves clean,Not literally in Jerusalem. I mean we don't want this to have sort of Zionist implications,- Right on - But on the other hand...,...we do recognize the right of the State of Israel to exist,But the West Bank should be a homeland for the Palestinians. and the Golan Heights should...,Well not both the West Bank and the Golan Heightsl,I mean no one supports Palestinian rights more than I do but...,Oh yeah right, Louis, like not even the Palestinians are more devoted than you.,I'm almost done,The fountain's not flowing now, they turn it off in the winter, ice in the pipes,But in the summer it's a sight to see. I want to be around to see it. I plan to be. I hope to be,This disease will be the end of many of us, but not nearly all,And the dead will be commemorated and will struggle on with the living. and we are not going away,We won't die secret deaths anymore,The world only spins forward. We will be citizens.,The time has come,Bye now. You are fabulous creatures. each and every one. And I bless you,More Life!,The Great Work Begins!

            I don't know about you,,but it makes me sore seeing those,war pictures about flying leathernecks,,and submarine patrols, and frogmen,,and guerrillas in the Philippines.,What gets me is that there,never was a movie about P.O.W. S...,...about prisoners of war.,My name is Clarence Harvey Cook -,they call me Cookie.,I was shot down over Magdeburg,,Germany, back in '43.,That's why I stammer sometimes,,especially when I get excited.,I spent two and a half years in Stalag 17.,""Stalag"" is German for prison camp.,Number 17,was somewhere on the Danube.,
,
,
,
,There were about,40,000 P.O.W. S there -,if you count the Russians,,the Poles and the Czechs.,In our compound,,there were about 630 of us.,All American airmen - radio operators,,gunners and engineers. All sergeants.,Now, put 630 sergeants together and,,oh mother, you've got yourself a situation!,There was more fireworks shooting,off around that joint...,Take the story about the spy,we had in our barracks.,It was about a week before,Christmas in '44.,Two of our guys,,Manfredi and Jonson, to be exact,,were just getting set,to blow the place.,Animal, Animal! Get up!,Betty Grable's on the phone!,- Here's your civilian clothes.,- OK, Hoffy.,Remember, bury your army outfits,before leaving the forest.,

,Your compass,is the top button of this jacket.,Anybody asks for your papers,,you're French labourers.,Here's your map,,Kraut money, Swiss Francs.,- Let's hear it once more.,- We've been over it a hundred times.,Let's hear it again.,We stick to the forest going west,till we hit the Danube.,We follow the Danube up to Linz.,In Linz we hop a barge,and go to Ulm.,Stop it, Joey!,Joey, go back to sleep!,Go on. You're in Ulm.,We lie low until night,,then take a train to Friedrichshafen.,We steal a rowboat,,get some fishing tackle,and drift south across the lake,,till we hit the other side - Switzerland.,Once there, give out a big yodel,,so we know you're there. It's a breeze.,- Stay out of this.,- Just one question.,Did you calculate the risk?,Ready!,You've got ten minutes,to get through the tunnel.,You'll come out as the Jerries,are changing shifts.,Blondie?,- OK,- Peel off.,- Show 'em, boys.,- Easy does it.,- We'll miss you, cruds.,- Auf Wiedersehen.,They ought to be,under the barbed wire soon.,Looks good outside.,I hope they hit,the Danube before dawn.,They got a good chance.,It's the longest night of the year.,- I bet they make it to Friedrichshafen.,- I bet they reach Switzerland.,- I bet they don't get out of the forest.,- What kind of crack is that?,No crack.

I said, hold it!,So we heard some shots.,Who says they didn't get away?,Anybody here,want to double their bet?,Every morning at six on the dot,they'd have the Appell- that's roll call.,Every barracks,had its own alarm clock.,Ours was Feldwebel Schulz.,Johann Sebastian Schulz.,I understand the Krauts,had a composer way back,with a Johann Sebastian in it.,But I can tell you one thing,,Schulz was no composer.,He was a Schweinehund.,Was he ever a lousy Schweinehund.,Aw, break it off!,You must get out for roll call!,Good morning to you.,OK, everybody, get up, get out!,OK, come on you sack rats.,Cut the beefing and get up.,Hey, Schulz.

Is that clear?,All right, then, gentlemen,,we are all friends again.,And with Christmas coming,,I have a special treat for you.,I'll have you all deloused,for the holidays.,And I'll have a little Christmas tree,for every barrack. You will like that.,Who did this?,I will give the funny man exactly,five seconds to step forward.,Then you'll all stand here,if it takes all day and all night.,That is better.,I see! 600 funny men!,There will be no Christmas trees,,but there will be delousing,with ice water from the hoses.,Dismissed!,We will remove the iron stove,,the one that was camouflaging,the trap door...,Animal, these Nazis ain't kosher.,You can say that again.,These Nazis ain't kosh...,I said you could say it again!,That doesn't mean you have to repeat it!,Private property.,How come the Krauts,knew about that stove, Security?,And the tunnel?,Why can't you lay down a belch,here without them knowing?,If you don't like,how I'm handling this job...,- It's got us all spinning.,- What makes them Krauts so smart?,Maybe they do have radar.,Maybe there's a mike hidden somewhere.,Yeah.

Reynolds,was looking for a,Rugged macho kind of a theme.,They come out and say,,""you, you, and you."",Now these are your new,winston men for 1981 and '82.,My jaw dropped, I was floored.,I literally was floored.,Never ever, ever,,ever thinking about,The outcome of what,exactly I was doing,And would have done over,the next eight years.,And that was being seven,and a half years as,The winston man, in over 42 ads,Showing smoking to,be, associated with,healthy activity.,'cause that's all,tobacco marketing is.,♪ yeah me and my winstons,♪ me and my winstons,♪ we got a real good thing,- After practicing as a,physician I then went into,Organized medicine and,hit it up the organization,Which is like the,mothership of doctors.,The world medical association.,And at that time we,were very, very strongly,Against tobacco.,Strongly against,tobacco industry,,Who we knew had lied about,the mortality/morbidity,Linked to their product.,And we knew that we,were up against a huge,Marketing machine.,- the flinstones,Has been brought,to you by winston,America's best selling best,tasting filtered cigarette.,♪ winstons taste good,like a cigarette should ♪,- did our first shoots,up in mt. Evans, colorado.,Which was pretty,educational for me because,You know what happens to,a three pack a day smoker,At 12,000 feet on,top of a mountain?,It ain't pretty.,Especially when,you're on oxygen.,And you're not able to smoke,When you're on oxygen,,'cause you'll blow up.,And I was there for a,good five, six days,With the crew.,They were trying to,capture the story,Of what our theme was.,Which was search and,rescue, storm searcher.,We would fly in with,a helicopter, okay.,We'd be out looking for,,whatever we're looking for.,Repelling off the side of,the mountain, which was,What they paid me to do.,And then, at the end of,the day was light up time.,Sitting on the top of the,rock, lighting a cigarette,With your buddy, passing,the cigarette to your buddy.,So the theme was, let's,tell a story about how,Macho these guys are,,how they're saving lives,,Search and rescue, and,then at the end of the day,The camaraderie is so special,that they have to have,A cigarette together to,celebrate their successes,That was the most machismo,that they could come up with,Which was now going to compete,with the number one brand,Of selling cigarettes, which,was marlboro, at the time.,Winston, at that time,,was only number four.,- 50 head of,cattle headin' for home.,Come to where the flavor is.,Come to marlboro country.,- Within two years winston,became the number two,Selling brand, right,behind marlboro.,How did that happen?,Marketing.,Marketing.,Marketing.,Spend more money,,spend more money.,Let's keep associating,this deadly product,With something that kids want.,- Gee, we ought to,do somethin' fred.,- Okay.,How's about taking a nap?,- I, I got a better idea.,Let's take a winston break.,- that's it!,- My job was to,deliberately to seek out,The vulnerable 13,,14, 15, 16, or 17,Year old and entice,them into thinking,That this is what they,too could be like.,That's all I did.,26 days a year I had to,work for r.J. Reynolds.,They paid me over,$100,000 a year.,Not to mention being on,billboards, magazines,,Penthouse, playboy,,popular mechanics,,Anything that would be a,male magazine considered,,That's where my ads were.,Because we weren't trying,to entice the girls,To smoke winston.,Because they had their own,,they had virginia slims,,And eve, and satins, and capris.,I was ballsy enough,to ask a question,Of the r.J. Reynolds,tobacco executive,,""how come you guys from,r.J. Reynolds don't smoke?"",They said, ""we don't smoke,the shit, we just sell it.,""we reserve the right to,smoke for the young, the poor,,""the black, and the stupid."",And billions of dollars,were there to fund it.,They're spending more,money marketing, okay,,Than a lot of people were,spending to prevent it.,- the u.S. Was,slowly starting to pick,Its act up to,introduce some taxes.,It couldn't make progress,on advertising bans,Because first,amendment protection.,The tobacco industry was,then trying to provide,Research grants to,researchers to buy them off.,Or to at least ensure that,the direction of research,Didn't go in more,of a negative way.,And that's when we had the,era of the large tobacco,Finance research groups,around the world.,- the,tobacco institute.,A trade association,with a unique objective.,To promote a free,and informed discussion,Of all issues involving,america's oldest industry.,- we had a study,done by the warton applied,Research center at the,university of pennsylvania,In 1979.,- We were involved in grants,with the medical college,Of virginia from 1930 to 1960.,- Of course there is a,never-ending concern about,The alleged effects of smoking,on the health of the smoker.,- The evidence is certainly,inconclusive at this time.,- There is no increase in,lung cancer mortality rates.,- An individual would have,to sit in a crowded bar,Or cocktail lounge,for more than 100,Consecutive hours to,inhale the equivalent,Of one filtered cigarette.,- Well this study was performed,by the american cancer,Society.,- That was proven,With the study funded, in,part, by the massachusetts,Lung association.,- Which confirms some of our,own thinking on the subject.,- I basically got into,the anti-smoking movement,Right after I graduated,from-- got a masters degree,In public health.,Where I learned that cigarettes,are causing more deaths,Than everything else combined,And nobody was doing,anything about it,And I got a job at the local,county health department,And I was told, ""oh,,you have tobacco because,""nobody else wants the job."",- back then, in the '80s,There were 32,billion packs a year,Sold of cigarettes in america.,32 billion.,- Nothing but the,best for mr. Ricardo.,- Winston filter brand.,- Feel the wonderful smoothness,deep down in your throat.,♪ here's to winston,♪ me and my winstons,♪ turn to salem,- Having done all,these ads that I did,And feeling pretty,good about the money,I wasn't listening to,the public's opinion,About tobacco because,right about then is when,You started getting,all the negativity.,Even though the surgeon,general's had talked a bad--,Talked about secondary smoke,And cancer being the number,one cause of premature death,and disease.,Now this is around,1987 now, '86,,'87, '88.,And I had been doing the,ads for almost seven years.,Now you're getting,all the scuttlebutt.,Now you're getting all,the hate, you're starting,To see anger.,Smoking's killing,people, we got proof now.,- It's best if,there is no smoking,So I can stay well.,Because it hurts people,like me who have asthma,And can cause lung cancer,even in non-smokers.,If I could, I would tell the,president to make it the law,That no one smoke,in public places.,- Things in life that he, he's,gonna come in contact with,In growing up,That he doesn't,have control over,Because we live,in a free society,And we have choices to make.,And smokers have choices,,as well as non-smokers,To be around people who smoke.,- The tobacco industry,,from the beginning,,First tried to do what I,guess any consumer good,Company would do,,deny the evidence.,- If you had your preference,Would you want your kids,,or your grandkids to smoke?,Or not smoke?,- I have no preference.,- We have no preference.,- I don't believe that,nicotine, or our products,,Are addictive.,- like,father, like son.,Think about it.,For information on,smoking and heart disease,Ask your heart association.,- there's now a,movement with the national,Cancer institute,,cancer, lung, heart,,Not to mention the government,and surgeon general,,That says hey,,smoking's killing people,And we got proof now,,now we got evidence,We got tobacco files, we,got people talking about it.,Now it's starting to,get a little curious.,Because I'm getting the,same thing from my kids.,Daddy, quit smoking, my teacher,says you're gonna croak.,Daddy, quit smoking,,you're gonna die.,Dad, you're gonna--,What happens?,My brother gets cancer.,My brother, I was the youngest,of three boys in my family,And he was my older brother,,he was only three and a half,Years older.,And he was diagnosed,with cancer.,And he was a smoker.,And, for about five years I,had to watch him deteriorate.,And I'm doing the ads.,When I did the ads, I was still,Worrying about my brother.,And I had this horrible,experience of driving,To boston, and he was in the,dana farber cancer institute.,And I walked through the doors.,Here we have oncologists,,doctors, nurses,People taking care of,people who are dying,,Literally dying,,From what they chose to,do at 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,,Et cetera.,Now they have to pay the price.,So now I'm starting,to get a little,Clued in here.,Well, maybe this is bad.,Maybe this garbage,is killing people.,My brother's dying from it.,I'm certainly not feeling,the way I did when I was 16,Smoking a pack a day.,Now I can't get up and,down stairs quite as much.,So I'm starting to see the,logic behind all the hate.,I started seeing smokers,being seen, not only as,Cool, macho, tough, rugged,,beautiful, sexy, glamorous,,Fun loving, free spirited,,But smelly, stinky,,yellow-toothed people.,Now you're starting,to see the segue from,60% of the american,people smoking,Or chewing or,dipping or spitting,,And now you're starting,to see the swing.,I had to make a decision,and there was a six hour,Ride home.,And I probably smoked,two packs of cigarettes,On that ride home.,'cause now I'm stressed.,Now I'm starting to feel,pretty bad about this because,Now I gotta go face my kid.,And I talked to my son,And I walked in the door,And he talked to me.,He said, ""dad, you're gonna,die like uncle bob, right?"",Boom!,Just like that.,That's how it hit me.,It was like a boom.,You know,There's a good,chance that I will.,That was my epiphany.,So long ago,That's how it hit me.,And, my passion for my kids,,And my wife was so grand,that I was gonna beat it.,Okay, so I made a,decision,It was July 17th,,when I told my son,,""I'm gonna quit.,""I promise, I'm gonna quit."",And, right hand up to,god, ""I'm gonna quit,,""I'm gonna quit."",And he said, ""okay dad,,you promise, right?"",Well what you don't,tell a 10 or 11-year-old,Is something then not do it.,'cause they will hound you,,and they will hound you,,And they will hound you.,Well he hounded me until,the great american smokeout,In November of 1988.,- You see this fan?,Well, I use it while I'm,around cigarette smokers.,But I may get a chance,to throw it away,During the great,american smokeout.,The day the american cancer,society asks every smoker,In america to quit for 24 hours.,- I picked that day.,I told my son I was gonna quit.,And, I did.,I get a call from every,philadelphia news station,,Television station.,I get a call from cbs this,morning with harry smith.,I get a call from,abc, I get a call,And they're picking,me up by limo,They're taking me to new york.,No one had ever quit,smoking publicly,,Especially the winston man,who's on every billboard,,Every magazine, everywhere,for eight years now,,Going on eight years.,And then he's biting,the hand that feeds him.,My brother's dying of cancer.,I promised my kids I wouldn't,hurt myself like my brother.,And I've seen so many,people dying that I'm not,Gonna do these ads anymore.,I can't do it.,I cannot physically, and,morally, do it anymore.,- Image has been a great concern,for the tobacco industry.,The person we choose,this week was once,One of the industries,leading image maker.,- The tobacco industry had,really played out to the peak,Of what it was going to do,trying to thwart policies,- Our long and difficult,four-year journey down,tobacco road,Has come to a victorious end.,- The largest financial,recovery in the history,Of the world.,- We've arrived at,our final destination,,And that's the destination,of tobacco justice.,- Close to 33,000 lawsuits,against big tobacco.,The precedence were being set.,So now if one person sues,,and you got the same disease,Then so on, and so on,,and so on, and so on.,So they sat around, and said,,""let's come up with a way."",And they went to meetings,,they went to private meetings,According to the tobacco,files that I've been privy to.,And they said, ""we've got,to come up with something,""that's going to,stop these lawsuits."",Well, here's what,you're gonna have to do,Big tobacco people.,You're gonna have to,give us some money back,In order for us to,convince our constituency,That that money, 'cause,we're sick and tired,Of paying for,medicare, and medicaid,Rehabilitation and prevention,Because your product has,cost us and our state.,Michael moore did,it, in mississippi.,Michael moore took,on big tobacco, said,,""I'm gonna sue your asses."",He's the only one that did it.,He sued, and won,12 billion dollars.,So then it became,even more important,That they justify this,money being spent.,Even if it was for,a year, or two.,They've never said they,were gonna use it forever,In the 25 years that,they're gonna get it.,Florida said, oh my.,I'd like some of that.,We have the same problem.,We're suing too.,They've got 11 billion.,Texas did it, they,got 13 billion,'cause it was all,based on per capita,And pro-rated a,number of citizens.,Minnesota did it.,Four states got,46 billion dollars,In a matter of a week.,46 billion.,Well, every other state wanted,to touch-- a piece of that.,We want some of that.,We, we're paying medicare too.,So let's come up with a number,that everybody can live with.,They came up with 200 billion.,Plus the 46 that went,previously to those four states.,And they gave attorney,generals 72 hours,To sign on.,And the only way they,would get any money,If they signed on without even,knowing what was going on.,And you'll get your money,over the next 25 years.,Every state did it, okay.,But, in that decision,in 72 hours they had to,Sign off that they would not,let anybody in their state,Sue big tobacco.,That was in 1999, and the,msa became the first bailout.,Yeah, we need it for the kids.,We need it for the children.,We need it for prevention.,Education.,Intervention.,Cessation.,We need all the ta ta.,- Like you, the nation's,attorney's general have been,Fighting to help reverse,the staggering toll,Tobacco takes on our society.,And to protect our children,from a lifetime of addiction.,- This plan, in short,,will get big tobacco,Off the backs of our kids.,- They got the money.,They signed on.,And then within two years,that money's,gone.,They either put it in bonds,,where they can't pay it back.,They used it for road repair,,waterfront restoration.,They used it for health,department's new computers,,The states are not using,the money that they said,They needed, and the,tobacco companies are now,Giving all this,money to the states.,And then nobody knew that,within 48 hours after they,Gave up 246 billion dollars,They raised the price,of cigarettes 48 cents,Across the board,,to make up the 246.,Nobody cares about it,,nobody wants to talk about it,Because it's not,scandalous enough.,- The tobacco industry,has conceded defeat.,And we have a settlement,of historic proportions.,- What did new jersey do?,They sold all their,money in a bond.,Now it's due to be paid back,And new jersey doesn't have,the money to pay it back.,There's eight states,that had done that.,The other states wasted,the money on everything,But prevention,,education, cessation.,So there is more corruption,,there's more government,Intervention for,keeping tobacco alive,And keeping the big,tobacco monopolies,Raising half a trillion,dollars a year.,Half a trillion, if not more.,That's what they admit to.,- by the time,of the minnesota court case,In 1998, the state of,minnesota didn't only seek,Redress in financial terms,,But required that,the tobacco industry,Place all of their,previously secret documents,In the public domain.,And from then on, we knew,the road map of the industry,And what it had,been since the '60s.,So it was only in retrospect,that we actually understood,Just how deep and pervasive,the influence had been,At the government level,,at the research level,,And at the individual,ministry area level.,As tobacco rates start,falling to maybe 20%,Or below 20%, you're getting,into a hardcore group,Of smokers who are not,smoking out of pure trice,But they're smoking,because they are addicted,And they have a physical need,for nicotine in their lives.,- I started smoking,cigarettes at 12.,And, really if I think,about it, my daughter's,Not too far from 12.,And thinking of her,smoking a cigarette is,Really just sickening.,The first time I ever smoked,a cigarette a few of my,Friends had come over,to spend the night.,And one of the older,ones had brought a pack,Of cigarettes from,her dad's carton.,We proceeded to go to the,tree house across the street,And we smoked the entire,pack of cigarettes.,I remember it made me sick.,It made me dizzy,,but more importantly,I remember from,that moment forward,Wanting to smoke cigarettes.,So, at 12, I mean you,can't really go out,And buy a pack of smokes.,So I would basically,do what I could.,I would take the,Burning cigarettes,from the ash tray,When my mother wasn't looking.,Or, take cigarettes,Out of her pack.,Or, even worse, I,would take the butts,Out of the ash tray, which,is really disgusting.,- It was not easy.,I probably quit seven,,eight, nine times.,And I come back hating myself.,My son looked at me, and,he looked so disappointed.,He knew I was smoking.,He knew that I had,just failed miserably.,But when the mindset,says I need to quit,,I want to quit, I have to,quit, I'm going to quit.,And then you try and you,fail, you try and you fail,,You try and you fail,,you try and you fail.,After awhile you say,,screw it, I'm done.,I'll go to my grave smoking.,- And those are the,people that are facing,Almost all the risks.,Those are the people that,are gonna account for,99% of the lung cancers,,Chronic obstructive,pulmonary diseases,And heart diseases,caused by smoking.,- We always need a disruption,To actually shift the market,and the market forces.,And I believe that hon,lik's work as the inventor,Of an e-cigarette,really represents,This disruptive change.,- Just a brilliant,,brilliant, brilliant,Moment in time which lots,of things came together,And hon lik took it and,actually made it a reality.,- Hon lik came up with,this brilliant invention,And that's the mark of,a true innovator, okay.,Somebody that can paradigmly,can shift things into,A whole new way of doing things.,- it was in 2005.,Originally, I wasn't that excited,When I saw just the,manual reading about it,Because I'm not a smoker.,When I actually saw the product,With the vapor coming out,I knew there was,something there.,So then we worked on,it for about a year.,And so I officially,formed siterra,In September of 2006,and we launched it.,Really our big breakthrough,was the ces show,January of 2008.,- I'm here at ces,And, I'm mostly interested,in gadgets and things.,But, this caught my eye.,This guy is here, and he,is not smoking next to me.,Because there is no,smoking on the show floor,But he's not smoking.,What is, what,exactly is in njoy?,- Njoy is an,electronic cigarette.,And the way that we do,this, is we take a battery.,From the battery we have a,patented vaporization system.,So what you're seeing,coming from the device,Is not smoke.,It's vapor.,- it became the hit of,the show and became written up,In a bunch of magazines,,and even online.,- it's a huge memory,void as to where I got,My first e-cigarette.,All I know is that I had in 2007,Two or three e-cigs.,One from china, one,from america, one from,Somewhere in europe.,And I'm playing with them,,that's all I remember.,And they're wonderful things,,like absolutely amazing.,But they're also really bad.,I mean, they are, what they,are are a proof of concept.,And I'm struck by,the potential here.,Thinking, oh my god,,this will be the product,That can transform,smokers lives.,But, this ain't gonna do it.,And then I thought, well, my,god there must be other people,Saying the same,thing as me, thinking,Close, very, very close.,And so, you know,,where do you go?,You look on the web.,And, nothing.,Nothing.,A few dodgy commercials,,if you kind of, you know,I-stock photo images of people.,I thought, god, we,need a conversation.,We need to start a conversation.,And what a better way,to do that than the most,Antiquated form of,internet communications,,A forum, that's what,we need, a forum.,So I set it up one night,in, I think, December 2007.,And,,Not much happened.,So, I went up, as you do,Around the internet,,and said hey guys,If you want to talk about,it come to my website.,And people came.,And we started a,conversation about,What are these products?,Where do they come,from, who sells them,,How much do they cost?,But principally,These things got to get better.,How are they gonna get better?,You know? What's the--,And we got very anal about it.,So we were taking photographs of,Tiny little pieces of metal,And connections and screws,,and things like this.,- I think that I,had seen a news story on,Cnn, or something, about,this new gadget called,An electronic cigarette.,And I was a heavy smoker.,So, you know, I had,a love of electronics,And gadgets, and I smoked,About two and a,half packs a day.,So I thought, well,,whatever this thing is,It must be for me.,So, I went online and,I found one,And back in those,days, you know, 2007,,All you could buy was these big,Bulky pen style e-cigs.,And I bought one, not,thinking much about it.,And it showed up one day,And I put it together,And, not really thinking,it would be too impressive,But I took a drag,,and I was stunned,I was absolutely stunned.,It was, I couldn't believe at,How closely it mimicked,the sensation of smoking.,And I remember later that,day, four hours had gone by,And it occurred to me,that I had forgotten,To have a cigarette.,I was just amazed by this,Way more than I,thought I would be.,But there was one thing,I was not amazed by,And that was by the taste.,It tasted awful.,You really didn't know,,in those days, you didn't,Know where the liquid,was coming from.,You didn't know how,it was being made.,You didn't know what was in it.,In those days, you,might be lucky if,You'd get a little,plastic bottle,With some liquid,in it that said,,""vanilla"" or whatever.,And that was it.,There were no companies,in the United States.,Everything was being made,overseas at the time.,And I was really,surprised by that.,So, at that point, it,wasn't about starting,A company for me.,It was about creating a,liquid that I wanted to vape.,That's all it was.,So, I started just,Trial and error, a lot,of trial and error.,I went out and bought,all the tobacco I could.,I bought cigarette tobacco,,pipe tobacco, cigar tobacco.,And just created this,giant tobacco mixture.,And what I decided to do was,I went and got five coffeemakers,And I lined them up,on my kitchen counter.,And, I brewed,,essentially tobacco water.,And I would use that,water as the water to,Filter it all over again.,By the time I was done,,I had a essentially,A highly concentrated,tobacco reduction.,And this, this was,the primary flavoring.,I went onto the ecf,And I asked if,anyone wanted to try,My new smoke juice, that,I was calling it by then.,And, you know, if you want,a free sample, let me know,And I'll send it to you.,And kind of figured maybe,,12, 13 people would reply.,And I had over 300 replies.,And it took about two weeks,And I got every,single request out.,And then the waiting began.,And it was the longest,week of my life.,And so I'll never forget,about six days later,I got an email,From someone who I,knew was sampling it.,And, and I remember,I had to pull over,Before reading the email,because I figured, okay,,Well it's all gonna,come down to this.,Either they hate it,,or they love it.,And, so I pulled over,I looked at the,email and it said,,You have to tell me,how I can buy this.,And, I thought, okay well,Maybe we have something then.,- it was around,2010 and I saw a friend.,He had a ciga, like,,You know, e-cig.,I asked him about it and,thought, oh that's cool.,A few months later,I did some research,And I got online and I found,there was a company in the uk,That was selling better devices,than what my friend had had,And I bought one.,And the day that e-cig arrived,Was it was a life changer.,Literally, as soon,as I started using it,I never had another cigarette.,I lost it one night when,I was out with friends.,And in the morning, I couldn't,find it, and it was gone.,And they're all quite,expensive back then and,You had to order,them from overseas,And I couldn't afford to,replace it immediately,And I couldn't have,even if I wanted to,,there were no shops.,There was nowhere to buy them,in australia at the time.,So I went back to smokes.,My sister died at,34 years old.,From non-hodgkin's lymphoma,In her lungs.,And, there's no question,that it was the smoking,That did it to her.,And, I've been trying,to quit for years,And this had been the,thing, the game changer,,That changed everything for me.,Not being able to buy it,locally just seemed insane.,So I started a business,and it was great.,It was almost word of mouth,at the beginning it was,Just an online store.,But it started to,get some traction,- The hobbyist side of,things that you see today,Really started,very, very early on,With this kind of real obsession,With precisely what,these devices are.,And what made two,devices different.,And that's really,how it all started.,- As we've seen in so many,other areas of technology,,Suddenly the cozy way,in which public policy,Has driven tobacco was,challenged by something new.,- I don't think that people,either on the public health side,Or the tobacco side, expected,how consumers would respond.,'cause it seems that the,formulation of the early,E-cigarettes met a need of,a smoker to have what they,Really what many of them,wanted, 70, 80% want.,To get nicotine's,pleasures without getting,the damaging effects.,- have we,got a solution for you.,The all-exclusive smoking,everywhere electronic cigarette.,Are you ready for a change?,- In 2009 and 2010,,us customs agents,Seized almost 1,000,shipments of e-cigarettes,At us ports.,- they made a,determination that it was,A drug delivery device.,That since it was,battery operated,That it was a device.,And therefore under,their fda drug delivery,There wasn't fda approval,for it,,That they could,seize the product.,And they seized, I,think probably about,Half a million dollars,worth of product.,And the product, when they,got it back, was worthless.,- Two e-cigarette companies,,smoking everywhere and njoy,,sued the fda,In 2009.,- We were reasonably,pessimistic at the time,And of course, we had,nowhere near the numbers,Of people using the products.,- This was an industry,that needed all the,Help it could get.,- one of our moderators,was actually day to day,Checking the court documents,And finding out whether,there had been an update.,We were on tenterhooks.,I mean, I talk about the ecf,would only last two years,,But right then, we were,thinking everything was,Gonna just disappear.,There was absolutely,no certainty whatsoever,That the judgment,was gonna come back,Against what the fda,was doing at the time.,- There as definitely,a prevailing sense that,If the ruling came down,in favor of the fda,It likely would have meant,the end of the industry,Before it really had had a,chance to get off the ground.,- I filed an amicus brief,with the dc court of appeals,In 2010 in support,of their case.,And we won.,- the us district court,for the district of columbia,Has issued a decision,granting leading global,Electronic cigarette,brand njoy's motion,For preliminary injunction,seeking to prevent,The fda from detaining,,or refusing admission,Into the us of its electronic,cigarette products.,- We had the hearing,in September of 2010.,And actually on pearl harbor,day, December 7th, voted,Three-nothing in our favor.,The fda tried to appeal again.,They turned them down.,They announced they,weren't gonna appeal,To the supreme court.,- There's a lot of,celebrating going on.,- Njoy's a hero,in this industry.,For having carried that,case to its final conclusion,They really are.,Because without that, I,don't think anybody else,Could have stepped,up to the plate.,- I remember thinking that,This is the start,of the industry.,- there's a new,warning this morning that,E-cigarettes may not be,as safe as they seem.,The new England journal of,medicine says e-cigarette,Users are five to,15 times more likely,To get formaldehyde,related cancers,Than long-term smokers.,Formaldehyde is the toxic,chemical found in the devices.,- This is the part in,our journey where people,Are actually using these,devices reached out to us.,They felt like it had,to save their lives,Yet it was under attack.,At first, we were skeptical.,Just like everyone else,,we'd seen the headlines,That vaping might be more,dangerous than smoking,Cigarettes.,- This is a dangerous product.,- It is a poisonous,product of nicotine.,- New studies show that,e-cigarettes are more deadly,Than regular cigarettes?,- These really,have me concerned.,- These products are,exposing you to a variety,Of toxic chemicals.,- Understanding that,over a billion people,Are gonna die this,century from smoking,We knew we had to,find the truth.,Because I'm not a,smoker, or a vaper,,We packed our bags and,headed around the world,To meet with leading,scientists and health experts,To find out what,was really going on.,- I think the first thing,the world needs to know,About vaping is,that all of the harm,And the billion lives,that we're talking about,And in tobacco use,,comes from smoking,,Comes from setting fire to it,And inhaling the smoke.,So it's the toxic,particles, the toxic gases.,That's what's doing the damage.,- The real problem is if,you set tobacco a light,And you inhale it,,It's bad for you.,If you put a piece,of beef in the oven,And you overcook it,And you eat it,,it's bad for you.,Anything you set to light,and inhale or ingest,Is bad for you.,- If you weren't to smoke,,you've solved the problem.,We know how to deal,with the smoke.,So, I think people,working on this,Every morning, just like,clinton when he first ran,For president had,that sign saying,,""it's the economy stupid."",To remind him every day,what to concentrate on.,It's really simple.,It's the smoke stupid.,- A normal cigarette has,at least 4,000 toxicants.,Including-- it has,nicotine, as well.,And if a consumer would,take all of that on board,They are-- one out of,two of those consumers,Will develop disease,and die an early death.,Solid evidence to back that up.,- If somebody would have said,,""bill, can you think of a,""parameters of a product,to replace cigarettes."",Theoretically I've had,said, ""well, it would be,""99% less hazardous,than cigarettes.,""it wouldn't be,addicting non-smokers.,""it wouldn't encourage anybody,to switch to cigarettes.,""and it would help lots,of people quit smoking."",That's the ideal solution,to the cigarette epidemic,In this world.,And it's called vaping.,- It's not smoking.,There's no tobacco.,Nothing is lit on fire.,Vaping uses a battery,,Which powers an atomizer,,Which vaporizes a liquid.,Which may, or may not,,have nicotine in it,,Has a flavoring, and is,made with an fda approved,Food grade liquid base.,- Well I first became,interested when some of the most,Hardened smokers that I saw,as a general practitioner,Started giving up,with the use of these.,That really sort of,sparked my fascination,With this whole idea,of turning the idea,Of quitting on its head,instead of being about,Denial and withdrawal.,But being about,something exciting,And something,better than smoking.,- it's gonna,be one of the biggest,Contributions to public,health this century.,It's a really,transformative technology.,And just think back a,hundred or plus years,When the cigarette,was first invented,,That was transformative.,It did away with all,the other kinds of,Tobacco products.,E-cigarettes are gonna be,equally transformative.,- It can save a billion lives.,- Anytime someone attacks,a promising alternative,To a massive problem,And you have to ask, why?,The answer is money.,Money,And one of the most fascinating,alliances in history.,- Well there are lots,of forces that play,Pro-vaping, and anti-vaping.,And it's hugely complex.,- The war on vaping began,with the fdas attack.,But they weren't the,only ones on their side.,To fully understand this,alliance that formed,We need to go to,the american south,And the theory of the,baptists and the bootleggers.,In many counties, they,hold periodic votes,To decide the fate,of alcohol sales.,An unholy alliance forms,between the preachers,Who don't want alcohol being,used in their communities.,And the bootleggers are,willing to sell alcohol,When and where it's not legal.,They're happy to help the,preachers restrict alcohol sales,Because that kills,their competition.,It's a classic example,of the enemy of my enemy,Is my friend.,At the end of the day they,both drive around town,With the same bumper stickers.,Unfortunately, counties that,vote to restrict alcohol,Sales have higher rates of,drunk driving fatalities.,We see the same two,sides in the vaping wars.,You have the bootleggers,who are opposed to vaping,For business reasons.,And you have the preachers,who are opposed to vaping,On moralistic grounds.,Well let's talk about,the bootlegger side.,Remember big tobacco?,They don't like competition,for their one trillion,Dollar business.,- analysts say,electronic, or e-cigarettes,Will become a two,billion dollar industry,Worldwide by the,end of the year.,With some predicting,sales will outpace,Conventional cigarettes,within five to 10 years.,- Cigarette companies realize,That e-cigarettes,are now a threat,To the old business.,- And, are they?,- It's one of the very rare,cases where you have,Such controversy,about the product.,And to the point that,people don't understand that,It is the main competitor,of tobacco cigarettes today.,The e-cigarette is,the main competitor,of tobacco cigarettes.,- some people,have had changes in behavior,,Hostility, agitation,,depressed mood,,And suicidal thoughts,or actions while taking,Or after stopping chantix.,Some people can have allergic,or serious skin reactions,To chantix, some of which,can be life threatening.,Patients also reported,trouble sleeping,And vivid, unusual,or strange dreams.,Talk to your doctor to,find out if prescription,Chantix is right for you.,- Drug companies know,that doctors hold all,The real power in the,prescription drug business.,- break the,hold of nicotine addiction.,See your doctor,about treatments.,- While they spend nearly,four billion dollars,A year marketing directly to us,They spend an estimated,24 billion dollars a year,Marketing directly to doctors.,- Big pharmaceutical,companies also lovingly,Known as big pharma,,want to protect their,Six billion dollar nicotine,replacement therapy business.,- not only are,they trying to ban,All their competitors,,The smoke-free alternatives,,But they are trying to,promote gums, patches,,Lozenges and any,fda approved drugs,As the only effective,was to quit smoking.,- I'm not a big fan,of nicotrol, nicaband,,Habitrol.,The inhalers.,Which contain the exact,same thing that vaping,Devices have.,The propylene glycol.,The only thing it doesn't,have is the the flavors.,- nicotine,replacement therapy,Which is not an,attractive product at all.,And it does not deliver,the success that it should.,- Okay, I'm gonna,cook the purple one.,- he gets the,prescription from his doctor.,It's also found in,the over the counter,Anti-smoking drug zyban.,But crushed,,cooked, and injected,It delivers a crack,cocaine-like high.,Each hit leaves a scar.,Skin abscesses, collapsed veins,,And clogged arteries.,Injuries attributed to,injecting wellbutrin,And zyban.,It's killed six,people in ontario.,- people go out and,get prescription for chantix.,No, that was fast-tracked,through the fda.,It has a black,box warning on it.,Could cause you to,have suicidal thoughts.,Could cause you,to commit suicide.,But that's fine, let's just keep,selling that crap, you know.,- If you look at,the united kingdom,And the solid evidence,which is being built up by,Robert wist, it shows,without any doubt,That e-cigarettes have,already supplanted,Nicotine replacement,therapy, medicine,,As the preferred way,for smokers to quit,Or to substitute their smoking.,- So if you have a,pharmaceutical company,Who's starting to see,your share of the market,On nicotine replacement therapy,Slide relative to these--,up and coming,E-cig people, what,are you gonna do?,You're gonna sit on,your bum and do nothing?,- under the korean,law, electronic cigarettes,Are considered cigarettes.,Until comprehensive research,proves that e-cigarettes,Are harm-free, and contribute,to quitting smoking.,Nicotine patches or chews,that are scientifically proven,To be safe, should be promoted.,- It made sense to find,big tobacco and big pharma,In the bootlegger camp,,'cause they sell things.,But it was confusing to,us when we found national,Governments were,right there with them.,- Governments worldwide,are the biggest,Shareholders in the,revenue of cigarettes.,- Using the united,states as an a example,,In 2010, the year that the,fda went after vaping,,The federal government,collected 15 and a half,Billion dollars,in tobacco taxes.,Just three years later, after,vaping began to take off,,Tobacco taxes were down,to 14 billion dollars.,That's a difference of one,and a half billion dollars.,- The e-cigarette industry,should be put out of business.,- The government's getting,billions of billions,Of billions of tax revenue.,- But it's not just the taxes.,Some countries actually own,their own tobacco companies.,- The chinese national,tobacco corporation,Is the main supplier,of cigarettes.,It's 100% owned by the,chinese government.,So in effect, the,chinese government,Is the world's largest,tobacco company.,- japan tobacco,owns the camel brand.,Besides those two, there,are 14 other countries,That own large,tobacco companies.,So who are the preachers?,Unfortunately, these,are the people smokers,Go to for advice.,Their medical professionals,and other healthcare,Organizations.,Like the cdc,,Fda,,And the world,health organization.,- The fundamental,truth, I think is that,The battle in the end,became very personalized.,It became public health,versus the tobacco industry.,- Tobacco control has,had decades of doing,The same things.,Just, you know, screwing,down the controls,A bit harder, increasing,the taxes a bit more.,Doing plain packaging.,None of which I disagree with.,But, when something comes out,of totally out of left field,,I don't think they know,how to deal with it.,- The groups that were,kind of in charge of that,Around the world, felt that,really they were in the,Final leg, the final push,Would just end,this story forever.,- And now we cannot,allow e-cigarettes,To snuff out the,progress we've made,Preventing nicotine addiction,and its deadly consequences.,- It's shocking to hear,,I almost, you know, flinch,When I hear, colleagues,saying things,About e-cigarettes that we,know, or they should know,Are completely wrong,,exaggerated, or scare-mongering.,There's too much,of that going on.,- We don't know enough,research in terms of,The long-term risks.,- The jury's out on this one.,They might, or might not,be able to help you quit,But there are definite,harms that they can cause.,- We don't yet,know about vaping.,- It's the same as antifreeze.,- We used to have very,dangerous products,And the makers of those,used to lie about those.,We now have much safer products,And the public health,communities lying about those.,- We know that they don't,actually allow people,To stop smoking.,- now there's,even more evidence that,That these are a gateway to,smoking regular cigarettes.,- These cigarette makers,are making these for kids.,Because they make chocolate,,and other flavors.,- What's going on?,- Frankly, they don't think,they can see too clearly,Sometimes when it,comes to a product,That involves nicotine,,like e-cigarettes.,Because of the association,with tobacco that just,Seems to blot out the,sun for these people.,And they can't look at,the facts as objectively,As they otherwise might.,- In many people's mind,,nicotine is so closely,Associated with,tobacco and smoke.,That they don't separate out.,This is just one,of the components,In a cigarette.,- What we always used to say,in the stop smoking services,Is that nicotine is as,addictive as heroin and cocaine.,But actually, we're,finding more now,That once you take it,out of the cigarette,Which we know has got,other chemicals into,Enhance the action of nicotine,It doesn't seem to,be so addictive.,- You never see anyone,sniffing pure nicotine.,You never see anyone,injecting pure nicotine.,No one wants to inject or to,use nicotine in a pure form,And you know it,would be much cheaper,To get nicotine as a solution,Rather than to use, to,take it from cigarettes.,But everyone likes,cigarettes because it's,Not only nicotine.,- It's not particularly,dangerous in itself.,Some people are saying,,well, in terms of risk,It may be on the level,with, say, coffee,Or something like that.,- nicotine is,a mild stimulant.,We have data from sweden,which-- where they have,Huge rates of nicotine use,Lifelong use.,The rates of lung,cancer are half that,Of the rest of europe.,The rates of heart,attacks are half that,Of the rest of europe.,And the reason is because,the tobacco they use,Is a special smokeless,pasteurized product called snus,Which is a harm-reduction,product, much the same,As electronic cigarettes are.,And so we know that really,lifelong use of nicotine,You can't measure any,significant health,Impacts from that.,- The data we have on that,is, it really comes from,Looking at people,using patches and gums.,And the data show that,you can use nicotine,For many many years.,- Many people have gone,on to be lifelong users,Including I might say my sister,,With no additional risk,,but dramatic declines,In their probability of risks.,And I think part of it,is the way physicians,,Nurses, health,professionals get trained,And the way they send,their message forward,They often don't know,that very simple fact.,- What I'm extremely,disappointed with in myself,And in our movement,,especially around the,Framework convention,on tobacco control,Is that we did not recognize,the simple role of nicotine,,Molecule nicotine,,And the possibility of,tobacco on reduction.,Frankly you don't,get people to move,And especially not,one 1.4 billion people,To move by giving them a sermon.,And lecturing them and,saying, you quit or you die.,Here's some nicotine,replacement therapy, or gum,Or your patch, you'll,only be allowed to use it,For 12 weeks.,Because, you're the bad person,,you need to stop smoking.,And use this and then let's,hope that we can fix you.,And that's a gap, and,it's a great failing.,- what struck me, was,in my career, which extends,From working on tobacco in,south africa through who,,Is how rarely we,actually make the point,Very clearly, that nicotine,addicts, tar kills.,That very simple separation,of what's in a product.,And yet we've,known it for years.,It was in the original,surgeon general's report,In 1964, clearly stated,That long-term use of,nicotine alone confers,Very little to no,harms on people.,- do those,professionals actually know,How people die of smoking?,And then you get to the,disturbing fact that,If you ask the,question to, let's say,The physicians in america,,""does nicotine cause cancer?"",Simple question.,Does that cause cancer?,70% of them would say yes.,And the science is,absolutely clear,That nicotine is,not a carcinogen.,It is an addictive agent.,So it's part of the ritual,and the attractiveness,Of people smoking cigarettes.,But it's not the,nicotine that kills,,It's the tar and the smoke.,We weren't honest,with our patients.,If health professionals, and,those who are in a position,Of trust, where people,would want to confide,Or discuss quitting,,You would want them to,have the right information.,And that, to me,,was the shocking,Shocking part, in myself,,is that I,Did not know that nicotine,is not a carcinogen.,So where I would have,been in a position to help,My patients, or family,members who smoke,With less harmful products,So that they, if they,couldn't stop or quit smoking,They'd at least switch to,something less harmful.,And unfortunately, the,health professionals,Especially physicians,are normally,Not in a position where they get,Feedback when they are wrong.,Very honest to say that I,personally got it wrong.,- Fda's own funded,scientists came out and said,That vapers are,exposed to dramatically,Less toxicants than,Smokers.,And they are exposed to very,similar levels of toxicants,As non-tobacco users.,Unfortunately, the fda,officials, when they,Talk to the news,media, don't say that.,- The dilemma is you, you,can't get 1.4 billion people.,It's the size of,the catholic church.,It's the size of the,indian population.,All to quit smoking,cigarettes tomorrow.,It's just not going to happen.,So the alternative,is to provide safer,,Not safe, but,safer alternatives.,- all these other,products are so much less,Hazardous.,And yet, our public health,agencies are saying,,No, no, you have to,absolutely stop all tobacco,And all nicotine use.,That's their goal.,♪ lollipop lollipop,♪ oh lolli lolli lolli,♪ lollipop lollipop,♪ oh lolli lolli lolli,♪ lollipop lollipop,- As we look at the,arguments against vaping,From the preachers, it seems,that there's an issue of pride.,Nobody likes to admit,that they're wrong,,Especially when,they're the expert.,- my name is,serena chen, I'm with the,American lung association.,- Every time we watched a,public hearing about vaping,It was intriguing to see,that one of the major,Health charities was there,to attack it immediately.,- The anti-tobacco community,Is also a small,economy in itself.,- Cancer, heart, and,lung, for the last,20 years, their tobacco,control advocacy,Has all been financed,by pharmaceutical grants,And contracts.,- I found out that cancer's,150 billion dollar industry.,Hmmm.,The american cancer,society, you know,,Most profitable non-profit,organization out there.,- Every advertisement,on television you saw,For gums, patches, and,lozenges for the nicoderm,,Nicorette, and commit lozenge,It said, sponsored by the,american cancer society,And it had the american,cancer society logo on it.,- Every state has a chapter,,every county has a chapter,,And every city has a chapter.,17 to 18% of that,money goes to research.,The rest goes to the,multi-million dollar salaries,Of all of the ceos, cfos,,Coos, cdos,,Clos.,Everybody's got-- and so,on and so on and so on.,I just know that people keep,donating year after year,After year after year,and we have more walks,And more relays,and more ribbons.,Because people haven't,done what the problem,Needed to be done.,And that is, stop the,source of the problem.,You go to a river, you,see a baby floating down,,A dead baby floating down.,You pull in the dead baby,,I'll pull a dead baby,,Another dead baby comes,out, pull out a dead baby.,All we're doing is,reaction, pull out dead.,Look, go to the beginning,of the mouth of the river,And see who's throwing,the babies in.,Then stop that person,then maybe we won't have,The dead babies,floating down the river.,I know I'm being,obnoxious here, but,It's as simple as that.,- If the tobacco model as,we know it were to change,Drastically, all,of those ngo's,Would be out of business.,They're holding onto the phone,,They don't want,the phone to die.,- Then I started,investigating the product,And I could see the potential.,I was worried, also,,Because potential was very high.,I said, wow, my smoking,cessation center,Would be out of,business in a matter of,A few years.,- So we have the bootleggers,With their billions of dollars.,And we have the preachers,With their loud voices,and trusted brands.,How does this truth,stand a chance,Especially when the vast,majority of vaping advocates,Are a rag tag bunch,of unorganized vapers.,And their loudest group,are the cloud chasers.,♪ I hear the freaks,,freaks, freaks come out,♪ they don't stop dancing til,♪ the sunlight hits their eyes,♪ I hear the freaks,,freaks, freaks come out,♪ and this club's lookin' like,♪ everyone's lost their mind,♪ heading tonight,♪ li-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-ive,♪ I get the feeling that,tonight's on for sure,♪ inject my blood with,the bass line black light,♪ I hear the freaks

smoking can be fun.,You don't see websites,devoted to the latest patch.,You know, you don't,see any chat like that.,You see masses of chat,in the forums and so on,,People talking about these,devices, how they're using them,And so, it's kind,of interesting.,It's kind of a bit,of a community sense.,- they're,hanging out together.,They're a group again.,They're family.,They were persecuted, he,was persecuted, and she was--,So now they can,all come together,And they're not gonna be,persecuted anymore because,They've done what,we've asked them to do,And that is find a,safer alternative.,♪ whoa whoa,- But the vast,majority of vapers,Are moms and dads,,Grandmas and grandpas,,Your neighbors,,Who are desperately,trying to quit,Something that is,slowly killing them.,- I'm from the uk.,I'm a dad.,An it engineer.,A vaper.,An archer.,A cook.,A husband.,Used to be a chemist.,And,,Used to be a smoker.,I tried an rt, and,I've tried cold turkey.,And I tried all sorts,of things to try,To give up smoking,because I knew,That it was making me ill.,And the year before I stopped,smoking I had more than,Four serious chest,infections that required,Inhalers, and drugs,,you know, it was crazy.,Just over five years ago I,came across this bad boy.,I haven't got rid,of it because well,,It's kind of a savior.,On that day I stopped,smoking tobacco.,That was it.,I quit.,That's pretty powerful stuff.,I just got the device myself.,I didn't need anyone's help.,I didn't need a prescription.,I didn't need a,doctor's say so.,I didn't need a hand out,from the government.,Or the health authority,,or a charity.,I just quit smoking.,That's mad.,That's kinda cool.,- In the meantime, the,people who have the power to,Help them quit smoking,find themselves,In a conflict of interests.,Let's look at the fda.,The fda is known to have,a history of hiring people,From big pharma, and then,once they're done at the fda,They go back to big pharma.,It's a revolving door.,The current head of the,fda center for tobacco,Is a former lobbyist for,the big pharma company,That sells nicorette gum,in the United States.,This is the same,division that in 2014,Proposed banning 99% of the,vapor products on the market.,- It will ban more than 99.99%,Of all e-cigarette products,on the market today.,- Over in california, state,senator leno was accepting,Large campaign contributions,from big pharma,While at the same time,proposing regulations,And taxes on vapor products.,- We are at risk of,losing 25 years effort,And a two billion,dollar investment,In keeping a next,generation from becoming,Addicted to the killing,drug of nicotine.,We have information from,not only the california,Department of public,health, which has declared,These devices to be,dangerous and unsafe.,And they are currently,in the midst of an,Educational campaign.,You may have seen some of,the television commercials,That are out right now.,- you,smoke pack after pack,Day after day.,♪ I'm back in baby's arms,♪ I missed those lovin' arms,- your day stays fresh.,♪ I'm back where I belong,♪ back in baby's arms,- And then you're gonna hear,from all the health advocacy,Groups, the lung association,,the heart association,,The cancer society,All those who are,in the business,Of protecting public health,Will be speaking in support.,- The american cancer society,took endorsement money,For nicotine patches and gum,And then released,official statements,Warning against vaping.,- For disclosure, neither I,nor smoke-free pennsylvania,Has ever received,any funding from any,Tobacco company, from,any drug company,,Or from any e-cigarette company.,Most of the anti-tobacco,movement, the,large organizations,For the last 20 years, the,campaign for tobacco-free kids,,The american cancer society,,the american heart association,,The american lung association,,the american academy,Of pediatrics, the american,medical association,And many more have received,hundreds of millions,Of dollars from the,pharmaceutical companies,That manufacture and,market the nicotine gums,,Lozenges and patches,And the chantix and,wellbutrin medicines.,For the last 10 years, these,organizations have been,Lobbying to ban all,smoke-free alternatives.,And we know they started,with smokeless tobacco,,With snus, with dissolvables,,With lozenges, the tobacco,lozenges that came out.,And then when,e-cigarettes came out,The first thing they did,was urge the fda to ban them,In 2009.,And the fda did.,- When you have this,kind of a triage, okay.,And then you have these,other people now feeding off,The tentacles, cancer, lung,,heart, getting all this money,From the government.,Getting money from the,master tobacco settlement.,What are they supposed to do?,- With all the lobbying from,big charities, it looks like,Government took the,convenient opportunity,To protect their,tobacco profits.,- The category is under threat.,Countries like,singapore, thailand,,Probably indonesia, australia,Have banned e-cigarettes.,We just had a vaper,from australia saying,She's smoked for 43 years.,She tried everything.,Patches, gum, behavioral,therapy, the works.,Didn't work.,She heard about e-cigarettes,and she asked her local,Pharmacist, can she have,that, she didn't have.,Then she found the quit line.,Could she have an e-cigarette.,She's tried all the other,modalities of cessation.,They said, ""no, it's illegal."",So that is sending,her to an early death.,- Twenty countries have,now banned e-cigarettes,Thanks to, due to world,health organization,Telling them to.,- In hong kong it's,a $12,000 fine.,And/or up to two years in jail.,In brunei, it's $10,000.,This is happening,all over the world,Where countries have banned,,or heavily restricted vaping.,- And you're doing,nothing about smoking.,So you're in a place where,you can get cigarettes,Everywhere,But you cannot get e-cigarettes.,- By banning all these,least hazardous alternatives,They're actually protecting,cigarette markets.,- A vaper...,From dubai.,He was telling me that,he had quit smoking,Two years ago with e-cigarettes.,But, he was forced,,By the government, due,to the ban, to illegally,Introduce e-cigarette,products in the country,In order for him to,stay off cigarettes.,So, you are forcing someone,to become, to do some,Illegal actions in order to,stay away from cigarettes.,And I don't see any reasoning,And any common,sense behind that.,- In some countries you,need a prescription to vape.,But you can go to the,store and buy cigarettes.,In australia, they ban vaping,liquids that have nicotine,In them because they say,nicotine is a poison.,Yet they sell nicotine gum,right in convenience stores,Without any sort,of prescription.,- Then three black suvs,Raided my house.,They had a search warrant,,a search and seizure warrant.,And they came in and they,went through all my things.,They bagged and tagged,everything they could find,Related to electronic,cigarettes.,And, yeah, they,took all my stuff.,It was horrible, it,was a scene out of like,It was like, it was like,they thought I was some sort,Of columbian drug cartel,,or something.,They were alleging that,I breached an obscure,Tobacco control act, a law,That said, it is,illegal to sell product,That is not a tobacco product,But is designed to,resemble a tobacco product.,Um yeah.,The law wasn't written to,block electronic cigarettes.,The law was written to,block candy cigarettes,,You know those little,white cigarettes,With the little,red ends on them.,That's what the law,was written for.,And the health department,were trying to stretch,This law and then,use it to block,The lifesaving,technology it was insane.,But nonetheless, they,took all my things,And I had to shut,the business down.,It was horrible,after all the success,And seeing the difference,I was making in so many,People's lives, to have it,shut down and taken away,Like that was just,,it was just horrible.,I felt, I couldn't let this go.,If I had given up at,that point in time,,It was over.,A precedent would have been set,Banning the sale,of these devices.,I can't possibly,explain what it's like,To tell your family that,You're gonna push,ahead with this thing,Even though it's probably,gonna bankrupt you.,But you're simply gonna,do it because it's,The right thing to do.,And then at the end,,after you do it all,And you go through all,of these sacrifices,And all of this pain,And all the fights,and arguments,,The court simply,ignores the argument,And simply finds you guilty.,The lives of millions of,australians and billions,Of people worldwide,don't appear to matter,In this situation.,It seems to be about money.,Somebody's got an agenda.,And it isn't about us.,Don't let the bastards win.,I think that's all for now.,- One of the biggest,vaping news stories in 2015,Was when portland state,university came out with a study,Showing that there was,more formaldehyde in vapor,Than in cigarettes.,- formaldehyde study,basically was a fraud.,The person who did it...,Set the pv on a wrong setting,And it would dry puff,,no vaper could use it.,- All the way up to,12, I'm not trying this,All the way through.,Wish me luck.,It can't be done.,- But they made a,machine inhale it.,And then they assumed,this machine would inhale,So many, hundreds of,inhales every hour,For the rest of their life,For 75 years they,projected it out to be.,And they added up,all these dry puffs,Of the machine dry puffing,for 75 years in a row.,And then said it might,be more carcinogenic,Than cigarette smoking.,But, it was a fraud.,A lot of these researchers,,they're mostly funded,By the federal government.,The food and drug administration,And the department of,health and human services,Through the national,institutes of health,And through the centers,for disease control,Are funding most of the,people who are trying,To ban e-cigarettes.,And they're funding them,to go out and lobby to ban,E-cigarettes.,- Even though it's,completely illegal,The cdc gave grants to the,washington state chapter,Of the american lung association,Who used that,money for lobbying.,This is what happened.,- king five news.,- For so many adults,,this has been a life,Changing intervention.,- now at 6:30 a,heated hearing in olympia,As the state tries to become,the first in the nation,To regulate e-cigarettes,like tobacco.,Staff bureau chief drew,nicholson looks at the proposal,That would make,washington's vaping laws,Some of the toughest,in the country.,- It's a violation,of federal law,To use federal funding,to lobby for laws.,But it's been going on.,The cdcs been warned,about it by the department,Of health and human,inspector general report.,They had hearings in,front of the us house,Of representatives, energy and,commerce committee on this.,The tom freiden was,warned that he could not,Insist in his grants,giving out the,State health departments,that they lobby for laws.,He was putting it in the grapes,And it's a violation,of federal law.,So this has been going on,,this is why all these cities,,Municipal health departments,,and state health department,Directors have come,out calling for bans on,E-cigarettes because,they don't want to lose,Their cdc funding.,And why these researchers,keep coming out,Every researcher that,comes out and generates,A news story saying e-cigarettes,contain toxic chemicals,Gets another 10 million,dollar grant from the fda,Or the national,institutes of health.,- Nothing motivates,people quite like fear.,Especially when it,involves their children.,- You know this recent,report found nearly,Two million middle school,and high school students,Have tried electronic,cigarettes, or e-cigarettes.,That set off some alarm,bells and this week,40 state attorney's,general called on the us,Food and drug administration,to regulate these cigs,Just like it regulates tobacco.,- The federal health,agencies goals,Was hoping by year,2020 that we could get,The past month smoking,rate among youth,Down to 16%.,It's down below 10% now.,Five years ahead of schedule.,And it's because,of e-cigarettes.,- The regulatory authorities,then confused the water,By saying, well,,maybe it reduces harm,But maybe it doesn't.,And we definitely,need more research.,But of course, we need more,research on everything.,- What do you think,,is it a question,Are they bad for you, or,we just still don't know?,- I think what we,can say basically is,They might be or might not,be able to help you quit.,But there are definite,harms that they can cause.,And those definite harms are,in different environments.,So if they get kids,hooked on nicotine,That's a really bad thing.,- Virtually all the,daily users of teenagers,Are either smokers, or,people who used to smoke.,And the problem is, the,researchers aren't disclosing,A lot of this daily use data.,So the only two surveys,have ever asked people,,Did you vape nicotine,,or no nicotine?,And they found 96%,of all non-smokers,Who had ever used an,e-cigarette in their life,Used no nicotine e-cigarettes.,- You've called this deeply,troubling in the past.,And, why?,Well, if you start,with e-cigarettes,There's a real likelihood,that you will become,Nicotine addicted.,- So called gateway effect,is used as a reason why,E-cigarettes should not be used.,If children start with,e-cigarettes that leads,As a gateway to stronger,drugs and to smoking.,There's no evidence,to back it up yet.,- Just applying first,principles to it.,If a product has,mainly only nicotine,And another one has,nicotine and tar,I don't think you need a,long-term 10 year study to say,The former is definitely a,better choice for a smoker,Who wants to quit,,than the latter.,- You don't think that,they had something,So solid that vaping,and e-cigs were deadly,And harmful, the,formaldehyde, the carcinogens,,The nico, the--,it's all bullshit.,- If you look at,the united kingdom,E-cigarette users up,to the end of last year,70% of them thought,that e-cigarettes,Were safer than,standard cigarettes.,That was their perception.,And in the space of six,months, that's dropped down,To an perception,rate of about 43%.,So through the misinformation,,bad science,It's hurt the category.,- Let me ask about the,other people who are,Around people who may,be smoking e-cigarettes.,Is the idea of secondhand,smoke, I mean we know about,That with cigarettes,,but some researchers say,The amount of potential,carcinogens in the vapor,Potentially is extremely minute,That it's insignificant in fact.,I mean, do you,disagree with that?,- Well we don't know what's,in more than 200 different,E-cigarette products out there.,What we do know is,that there is nicotine.,- They should be accurate,and responsible communication,Of the facts to the consumer.,And such a responsible agency,Would need to weigh their,words very carefully.,- The dangers of,e-cigarettes are clear.,Today's electronic,cigarettes are no better,Than the joe camels of the past.,- If all the smokers,of cigarettes today,Switched to,e-cigarettes tomorrow,,The billion lives,will definitely be,significantly reduced.,- It's the smoking,that kills people.,It's not the nicotine.,People smoke for the,nicotine, but they die,Because they inhale smoke.,- We have none of,the tar, the smoke,,Or the 4,000 plus chemicals,going into your body.,- There's no evidence,that vaping has caused,Or associated with any disease.,And we know that it's,helped several million,People quit smoking.,- So the billion lives,that we're trying to save,,Better do a hell of a lot,more than we're doing now,Because right now the,army isn't big enough.,A lot of people don't even,want to fight the war anymore,Because we're, it's,an uphill battle.,People are exhausted,and tired and frustrated,And angry and pissed off,And upset with the fact,that we can't fix it,Because it's truthful,,and it's right.,- But things are,not looking good.,- the numbers now,show that e-cigarette sales,Are down.,- Europe just passed,all kinds of rules.,They're gonna take beneficial,products off the shelves,And out of the lives,of thousands of people,Who are trying to quit smoking.,- It will close down the market,For the independents.,It will hand a majority,control to the tobacco industry,Who are producing devices.,And I think it will,be a damaging thing,To the whole of the,vaping industry.,I'm very disappointed in,the way things are going.,- Here in poland we have,Over one million vapers.,And we estimate that,After that,Heavy legislation,It will be 500,000,,Not more,Or even, even less.,We are trying to find a way,To,Fight.,It's not easy,because ppds already,A law in the european union.,- In the us the same thing.,The fda just passed,all kinds of new rules,That will keep millions,of people smoking.,- The fda has estimated that 90,,More than 98.5%,Of all e-cigarette,products on the market,Will be banned by,their regulation.,All e-liquid will be banned.,This is not a proposed,regulation to protect children,As the fda has presented it,falsely to the news media.,It's prohibition plan b.,- You know what,the fda's gonna do,,You know what eu's gonna do,,You know what,germany's gonna do,,You know what,malaysia's gonna do,,You know what brazil's gonna do,,You know what,argentina's gonna do.,We all know, the die is cast,,The cast is formed,,the stage is set,And the script is written.,End of story.,Why?,Because nobody cares.,- A billion lives.,A billion lives, a,billion people with names.,They each have a name.,And if you and I were,in discussion with them,,Would it not be fair and,responsible to provide,Them with the right information?,The question is, how much,evidence is sufficient,For that one person,sitting in front of you?,So if you the nurse, or the,pharmacist, or the dentist,,And it's your patient,,and they ask you,,""I'd like to use an,e-cigarette, what's your view?"",Then you can't say, ""well,,""we need to do more research."",That's just not helpful.,It's irresponsible.,- The public needs to know the,truth about these products.,- And they need public health,people telling the truth,About the risks.,At least 95% less,risky than smoking.,- If we look at the,history of public health,,The biggest breakthroughs,are associated historically,With two really,really simple things.,One, you give people enough,information that they,Can make an informed,decision about,What they're gonna do.,And two, you give them,the ability to act,On that information.,- It's a crime,Not to tell the billion people,Who will lose their life,Because they smoke,,Of the alternative.,- we are losing.,We are losing fast,and furious and big,And who's gonna lose?,The smokers, again.,Who are now trying,to transition over,When they've been asked,and begged and cried for,For years and years and,now we have something,That's viable, and we're,not giving it to them.,It's just shameful.,It's embarrassing.,This is not how people,should treat other people.,Especially under the,guise of public health,And compassion and,love and liberty,And freedom and all,that.,You know, I'm sick of it.,- What we have here is,that the best kept secret,In tobacco cessation,,tobacco reduction,Is the use of safer,alternative nicotine products.,And that consumers,are denied that right.,- We have this huge glaring,opportunity to do something,That would sort of rival,eradication of small pox,,Or dealing with,cholera, sanitation,Is one of the biggest,public health breakthroughs,We've ever had.,And it's staring us in the face.,And it's not,conceptually difficult.,And we've got examples,of where it's worked,And we look at things,like swedish snus.,We have proof of concept,that people can get,Their nicotine in far,less hazardous ways,And be just fine with it.,Uh, and it hasn't happened yet.,- And I guess really,what prompted me,To want to quit,Was seeing my uncle,Dying of lung cancer.,And without a shadow of a doubt,He was the most genuine,And kind-hearted person,I've ever known in my life.,- People are gonna die.,People are gonna get sick.,There are people who should,have had the opportunity,To grow old.,To be part of their,grandchildren's lives.,I knew firsthand the,experience that I had had,And how dramatic the,change in my life,And my health had been.,I'd seen dozens of,friends and family members,,Actually hundreds, really,,in the end of lives,That have been directly changed,By using these devices.,And the health department,,like that's their name,The health department,were banning them.,You can still buy cigarettes.,You know, buy and use any,tobacco product you like,But you can't buy,the alternative,That we know is,significantly, I mean like,Over 95% safer.,- And really I,just, I didn't want,My children to have,to see me that way.,I wanted to be,Able to be there,For them more in the future,And extend my life,For them.,And, essentially that,Is what vaping has done.,Vaping has helped me to,quit smoking cigarettes.,And for that, I am thankful.,- a billion,lives are at stake.,The status quo is winning.,Smoking is strong.,The battle rages on,even as you watch this.,Big business and government,are working together,All over the world,to serve the few,At the expense of the many.,We see so many examples.,In our food system.,Our medicine.,And now we see it in,the push to preserve,Smoking and its cash flow.,To condemn a billion,people to death.,Billions of mourning kids.,Billions of broken hearts.,We can choose a better approach.,We can end fear-mongering.,We can help our,neighbors live better.,We can help our,neighbors live longer.,And we must.,♪ I've heard a lot of,funny stories and opinions,♪ now to get the,whole thing straight,♪ you can't keep a,bunch of hypocrites,♪ and myers all from,showing their face,♪ but the damage has been done,♪ our battle's not quite won,♪ so let's take,it to the streets,♪ and sing for the sun,♪ what

,No, Floyd.,Offseason storms are exactly,why we should be worried.,The sudden appearance,of the Northern Lights,over the Bermuda Triangle,are why we should be worried.,Why is no one worried?,My bro,

tenure,,FEMA's response time,has been cut in half, OK?,My approval rating,is through the roof.,So maybe I know what I'm doing.,Now, Matt here was the smartest,guy that I went to MIT with.,So let's just let him finish.,Thank you, Travis.,But we're wasting time.,The anomalies that,I've laid out,,they're going hyperactive today.,The waterspouts,out there, they're,about to divide,and make landfall.,Sorry to interject, but,we've run operations,through the Triangle for years.,Waterspouts are not uncommon.,The pressure systems out there,are perfect for tornadoes.,Yes, indeed.,But these spouts aren't,affected by the weather above.,It comes from below,,gravitomagnetic surges.,Just look at the,seismic activity,coupled against the,magnetic activity.,The magnetism doesn't start,tornadoes or waterspouts.,No, not on Earth, but on,Mercury and on the Sun.,And I've been tracking the same,occurrences over the Bermuda.,Triangle.,They're whipping up spouts at,speeds of 300 miles an hour.,That's four times,as fast as normal.,So we need to evacuate?,Yes, immediately.,But that's not all.,It's about my,archeological findings.,Just take a look.,I swear to god.,What's he going to,bring up next, huh?,Find Atlantis?,Did you find Atlantis?,No, we have no proof,of Atlantis existing.,But I found shards,of pottery and bits,of an obelisk that,were brought up.,And they talk about weird,magnetic occurrences,,and the fissures I talked about.,But that's not all.,They talk about,massive creatures,,prehistoric beasts, monsters.,That area has brought up more,prehistoric aquatic fossils,than anywhere else on the globe.,We pulled up a megalodon,jaw on our anchor once.,Yeah, I read about that.,And that's not all.,I had sea turtles,,plesiosaurs, dinosaur, orcas.,A what?,Prehistoric alligator.,What else?,There were giant squids,,and octopuses, octopi, huh?,That's not what we,have to worry about.,It's the carbon dating.,It doesn't go back to,the Cretaceous period.,These findings, there are only,100 or decades of years old.,I thought we were getting a,briefing on a weather report,,Travis, not a,goddamn fairy tale.,I don't need to,stand here and

all just,take a deep breath,because last time I checked,FEMA was under my jurisdiction.,The last time I,checked, FEMA's funding,was under my jurisdiction.,So get this nutjob out,of here and put out,the goddamn message.,You see, General,,these spouts are only,a fraction of what you,need to worry about.,You need to worry,about what they're,bringing up from the deep.,Get them out of here.,Get these things,out of my sight.,I don't want to look,at them anymore.,I'm sorry I shouted at you.,It's OK, dad.,Well, that could,have gone better.,Well, I'm sorry, man.,But I'm not here to win friends,or make approval points.,I don't think there's,any danger in that.,You could have held off using,the word beasts or fucking,monsters.,No, I couldn't because I've,been shunned my entire

see this,thing through.,OK.,OK, now how much,time do we have?,I don't know.,Half hour, an hour?,Every minute up...,There as a minute,I wasted tracking the storm.,And these spouts, do,you think they're

extraction.,Bitch, she's got nothing.,And if think that you know, I'd,never seen a fucking jail time,because my network extends,all over the world.,I said shut it, Clive,,or I'll shut it for you.,Hello, Donovan.,Over.,Donovan, thank god.,What?,You cannot be serious.,Well, what the hell are we,supposed to do until then?,We need backup now.,Pam, we got to move.,Damn it.,What's happening?,The roads are flooded,,the trucks are stuck,,and the chopper can't,land on the roof,is too goddamn dangerous.,We're on our own.,That's going to be a problem.,And a fucking timing.,We can't just leave him.,Can't we?,No, on me.,This is a fucking beaut.,We're the only ones,down here, Kiff.,Our Channel 7 is going,to shit themselves.,Are we rolling?,Listen, Karen, I,got a bad feeling.,Start rolling.,All right, I am rolling.,We are in the shadow of,these quickly approaching,waterspouts.,They are massive,,and they seem...,Zoom in, Kiff.,Zoom in.,They seem to be,full of creatures.,I have never seen anything,like it in my life.,Karen, stuff is coming,out of these twisters.,We got to go.,Keep rolling.,Damn it.,Karen, you can stay,if you want, but I'm,getting help out of here.,Get back here.,Why are you stopping?,You can't do that.,Actually, I can because,it's an election year, Matt.,And I give a shit,about approval points.,I figured I'd kill myself,a couple of monsters,,maybe boost my approval rating.,Every crisis needs,a hero, buddy.,Now get out the fucking car.,What?,Out!,Out!,Get out of the fucking car.,Out!,Get out of the fucking car.,All right.,But I've got the calculations.,I know how to stop the thing.,I can disrupt the agonic line.,And why do you think I,want to do that, huh?,FEMA is in the,disaster business, OK?,The more monsters to kill,,the more approval points.,Do you understand?,You son of a bitch.,Thousands of people will die.,Oh, I'm so sorry, Matt.,You should have learned,your lesson at MIT.,Don't leave your,research where people,can get their hands on it.,It was you?,You fucked me.,I share everything with you.,I showed you all my research.,And you were the,one who did this.,You're fucking lied to me.,Don't be so surprised.,You made it too easy, Matt.,Honestly, it was like,shooting fish in a barrel.,It was embarrassing.,Now this is the point where I,say good luck, buddy, friend.,But we both know we're,not friends, right?,Now get out the fucking way.,Wait.,You don't leave me,here with nothing?,No, not nothing, Matt.,You've still got Floyd.,Fuck you.,Fuck you, Travis.,Fuck!,Fuck!,Oh, no, no, no.,I'm sorry, folks.,But I'm locking you in.,It's far too,dangerous out there.,My cousin called me and,told me that there's,sharks and gators and,all kinds of crab killing,people on the streets.,What a load of bullshit.,You're

show you.,The front desk DVR, I saved,the last couple of hours,from the weather feed.,Do you want to see?,Yeah, that'd be great.,Show me, please, yeah.,No offense, Matt, but how,did a scientist and a here?,And if you knew about all this,,why don't you tell anyone?,I was on the way,to the Pentagon.,I had a double-cross on,the way to the airstrip.,Well, that sounds like a trip,to Washington, all right?,Why were you going,to Washington?,I was hoping to brief the,president about the storm,and the creatures.,Do you the president?,No, not me, my,friend, ex-friend,,the one who double-crossed me.,Thanks for recording this.,Appreciate it.,Well, I'm a bit,of a weather nerd.,Pause it right there.,Yeah.,Can you zoom in on the back?,Sure.,Yeah, you see how it's moving,along the agonic line, right?,It's going to hit the,geomagnetic fields,,and then it's going to split and,multiply and then head north.,Waterspouts don't last,long on land, not even,once that strong.,And spouts don't move,along magnetic lines.,No, these aren't,like normal spouts.,They aren't affected,by weather patterns.,These are magnetic,,and they're going,to continue north and,continue to build energy,until they potentially hit the,North Pole unless we stop them.,Let them finish,that little meeting,,and then we're going to get,Clive locked up somewhere safe.,Hmm.,Safe?,He should be out there,with those things.,Easy.,Don't hurt him.,We need him in one,piece for the trial.,I'm sorry, but this whole,situation is freaking me out.,We all saw that giant,fucking crab, right?,Yeah.,Can we stand up and take,control of the hotel, please,,or something?,Right now our mission,is this piece of shit.,We're just got to let them take,care of their own protocols,,and if anything gets in,the way of our operation,,then we'll reassess.,What the hell is it now?,Speak.,Shit!,What was that?,No.,Oh.,No, honey, it's,not going to work.,Oh my god.,Holy shit.,What the hell are you doing?,Look, Tina

it.,Instinct.,Sorry.,Like I said, it's under control.,Look.,Maybe it's best we don't,leave our only protection,in the hands of the,angry prostitutes.,Excuse me?,What about this guy?,He's all tied up.,He looks strong.,He'd probably help us,when the time comes.,You don't fucking touch him.,And we're not prostitutes.,Sorry.,Escorts, call,girls, call people,,I just think it's a liability,that you're packing.,Don't judge a book by,its cover, asshole.,And you are?,My name's Matt.,Matt, well, you sure have,a way with women, man.,But I am Pamela,Rasey from the FBI.,This here is Pepper, and,this is Tina from Interpol.,Sorry, I...,This is Clive Delaney.,And you are right, Don.,He is strong.,He is really strong.,He's killed three people,with his bare hands,,and that is just in the time,that I've been trailing him.,So yeah, he probably,won't be much help to you,unless, I don't know, you,want to buy some children?,Yeah, he's a real piece of shit.,Then why'd did you,bring him into my hotel?,Because guys like him,don't like to be arrested,by undercover prostitutes,in front of their families,,do they?,Well, I'm glad we have,Charlie's Angels here,,but Matt is a scientist.,Well, that's one book I could,definitely judge by the cover.,And he knows all about,the weird storms.,Mhm.,That's great.,But what about the T,rex-sized octopuses?,Yeah, I know about those too.,Please enlighten us.,The storms aren't,like normal storms.,They're like flare-ups,you see on the sun.,And these ones originated in,the Bermuda Triangle, a place,we know very little about.,I know it's bad news.,Indeed.,And in my 20 years,of geological study,that led me to,archaeological study,because all the stuff that,was coming out of there, proof,of prehistoric life,,but nobody believed me,because it didn't,fit into museums,narrative of historical order.,So there's politics in,the science world too?,There's politics in all of it.,I've been forced out of,libraries, everything.,They laugh me out of,my own symposiums.,I bet.,Oh, I guess you're having,the last laugh now.,I'd be laughing a whole lot,more if I wasn't so scared.,Well, what can I do here?,Shut up.,Listen, there are dozens,of those things out there.,God only knows what's going,on in the rest of the city.,Sir, the last transport,is ready to roll.,Go ahead and get on it, Meghan.,I'm not going anywhere.,The majority of spouts,have passed us by.,But, sir, it's hell,on Earth down there.,Hell on Earth is,in Iraqi POW camp.,Do you think I spent two,years getting my toenails,pulled off to get,taken out by a storm?,You don't know Abernathy Wilson.,Sir, the monsters,Matt warned us about.,I have it covered.,But sir...,I said I have it covered.,The military has to know.,Is that who you were,checking in with earlier?,Yes.,Well, of course, the storm,has ruined any chance,of them getting to us.,And well, the comms have,gone out with the storm.,Yeah, of course, they have,because it's a magnetic storm,,and it's going to render,anything digital completely,useless.,Our only chance is maybe,using a shortwave radio.,Matt, I keep a shortwave,radio with my tools.,I left it over these tower.,Yeah, that'd be a big help.,We can you get a message out,,but without the government,shortwave passcodes,,they're not to listen to us.,Right, ma'am?,Well, I learned,Morse code in basic.,But shortwave codes and,they're from inside.,Tina, Pepper?,Don't look at us either.,Interpol phased out,shortwave years ago.,Well, there has to,be a way, right?,Matt, what about your,government friend?,Oh, he's dead.,But he did leave me some codes.,I have him in my go-bag.,Of course, I still have Floyd.,Who the hell is Floyd?,Then we'll go to,the tower and wait.,Woo!,Ha-ha.,Oh baby.,Oh baby.,It was a good job.,You look, like you,want

Our punishment is swift.,Lizzie was alone in the forest.,A sour spell had taken over her.,She struggled up a hill,the way a newborn calf,struggles to his feet.,She wobbled in and out,of the black shadows,cast by the cypresses.,Were there crows?,Yes. Shiny and loud.,Lizzie was on the lookout,for a circle of stones,,a healing place that was,assembled on the hill,hundreds of years ago.,The spell made her ears,hurt and her stomach turn.,She looked forward to laying,down in the circle of stones,,covering herself over with ferns and dirt.,The stones would dissipate,the spell or so she hoped.,Lizzie moved from tree to tree,,handling each one for support.,She was losing all her strength.,All at once, the insects all went dumb.,The crows were high up in the quiet.,Lizzie felt herself watched.,Did a black cat walk by?,Yes. Delicate and precise.,Lizzie felt thoroughly searched.,And then she saw hunter standing,on the side of the hill watching her.,The hunter was a woman,with a striking face,and powerful eyes.,Lizzie thought she was probably a goddess,there to guide her or else murder her.,Possibly do both.,Why are you here?,I wanna change my life.,What is wrong with it?,I've been a terrible person.,I'm in so much pain.,I need to think about my life,and find a new way to be.,And what if the change is death?,Don't you think it's possible,that you deserve to die?,I prefer to live.,If there's a way to live,and be changed, I want that.,What will you do?,Anything.,Do you have the authority to help me?,Yes.,An exchange is necessary.,You must bring me two.,Then you will have the,opportunity to reform,Two?,All right.,I'll bring you two.,I had a moment of recognition,,like a face that appears,suddenly at the window.,First, it's a surprise.

years,was like for each other.,Her time staying solitary and me trying,to make a life for myself.,Right now, there is a void between us,,a history of absence,and the pain of absence.,What might help is the shock of the new.,Shock of the new?,The idea is to,create a new beginning.,It must be a profound experience.,Something that regenerates,our relationship,,allows us to reshape our,understanding of one another.,What is this shocking experience?,It has to do with that thief.,There is an,old story about snakes,saving their hearts in humans.,Cold-blooded snakes can live for a time,without their hearts, gaining warmth,instead by gliding their bodies,across sunlit grass and stone.,To protect their hearts,from trample or combat,,snakes often hide their,hearts in stronger vessels.,There are people so cut off,from their own memories,,their hearts grow cold.,No disguise can truly hide them.,No matter their appointments,or how they surround themselves,,they are deeply alone.,Snakes seek out such people,to hide their hearts in.,People who don't know their,own heart won't notice,,they also carry a snake heart.,There are stories of people that died,from terrible loneliness.,As many as 20 snake hearts have been found,in a lonely person that died.,And sometimes, people die,when snakes come to retrieve their heart.,They see snakes approaching,and misunderstand the situation.,If the snake is cut in,two by a worried host,,there is a heart within,that person that dies.,If the snake strikes a person,,the poison that goes in the veins,will affect the hidden heart.,I'll tell you about axes and dirt.,There are people that bury their,axes but never forget them.,There are people who bury their axes,and uncover them every night,just to hold them in secret.,There are people who bury axes,who will tell you to your face,,they never carried an,ax in all their life.,Snakes are careful of,their bellies in dirt,where axes are hidden.,They know they have to put,their hearts somewhere safe.,They can sense those people cut,off from their own memories,,people with buried hearts.,Such obstinate sadness is,the perfect hiding place.,Word travels fast when,there is a suitable host,for the snakes to save their hearts.,But there is always a risk.,A person burdened by too many snake hearts,will find oneself standing,at the edge of a cliff,or deep water and look into it,,search it with the,bloody weight of desire,,desire that drenches the,world in a cold chill.,We watch out for such people.,♪ Priestly, prissy, Pastor Jack ♪,♪ Puts the girls of the,orphanage on their back ♪,I believe there are doubles,and we are each other's double.,Not an exact likeness.,Doubling is one of nature's,irregular patterns.,It's a way of expressing,personal satisfaction,and personal crisis.,Perhaps one struggle sets the,stage to live more wisely.,Even Prosperously.,I think that's the case with you and me.,You are alone working anonymously.,I have my students and my family.,I think what happened to you with old Karl,and how we fixed old Karl,,I think it resulted in an imbalance.,It's you.,You can hear me, like it or not.,I ate a concoction of grass and flowers.,It didn't make me whole, but,maybe it'll strike your fancy.,I'm not as wretched as you think.,I have human qualities.,When I was little, I drew,little forest creatures,wearing human clothes, Victorian,dresses and waist coats,,moist eyes looking out at you.,They weren't very good,and I think most of them,I traced out of some book,,but I could sort of see in them,what my mind intended them to be.,Portrait after portrait,,adding up to a little society.,I'd spread them out and feel fellowship.,Heaven allows individual damage.,A double can absorb some of that damage.,You feel her.,- Who?,- The hunter.,She's close.,Where?,Behind those,trees chewing on a dead doe.,She wouldn't want you,to see her like this.,Wait till after she's fed.,She's better after having blood.,I thought we'd find a,leveling experience out here,by this remote lake.,I knew about that fringe,group that lives in the woods,and how they've taken liberties,with the rental cabins.,The darkness that marks us is self-similar,to the darkness that marked the thief.,She stands before a mirror,and sees an image that's evolving.,The image supersedes the host,and soon,she'll be brand new,like a snake shedding its skin.,We're drawn back,,forever back into our,sin against old Karl.,Chop, chop,Chop.,It is the absence,of meaning in what you live,at the moment you are living it,which multiplies the,possibilities of your imagination.,I grew up in the country.,I grew up in the city.,Probably the things I had were,nicer than the things you had.,Probably.,Were you happy?,I had thought life isn't worth living,,but it is worth thinking about.,I remember when I was small,,I was once held down,by several older boys.,That set me off to a bad start.,That's horrible.,I'd like you to,consider how you might go on,thinking about your life even,after you lose your life.,Think about what everlasting means.,I was daydreaming.,Where did you take me?,To see the hunter.,She's ready for us now.,Where are you going?,I'm leaving.,No. There's momentum for us now.,I don't want you,coming around the cabin.,Leave us alone.,I don't need to go,to your cabin to find you.,I'll alert the rangers.,We are tethered now,and you don't need to be afraid.,Let events run their course.,Chop.,Chop.,Chop.,Heaven allows individual damage.,A double can absorb some of that damage.,A double prepares us for survival.,I thought a thief might provide,us the shock of the new.,We'd have a new challenge to unite us.,A shared experience that,would allow us to begin again.,Hey you!,Moving forward, that would be,the story we would tell,,how we chased a thief that,trespassed against us,,ran her deep into the forest and gone.,This story would supplant,the story of old Karl.,Narrative is everything.,Story puts all our,experiences and all our dreams,into balance, but our doubling,now involves uncertainty.,Someone messed up the narrative.,A player has gone rogue.,She's using us as her double,,preparing her own survival at our expense.,An elaborate double-cross.,Something in the woods gets,her power to pull it off.,A person cannot,know whether the next moment,will be not like any other moment,,but one that will change,their life or end their life.,A deer in the woods,goes about its business,knowing only by instinct,what sort of creature it is.,The one who draws her bow, that is the one,who knows what the next moment will be.,She will line up her arrow and change time,for what is standing in her sight.,Do you understand?,Who am I to you?,You are the hunter.,Do I have the,power to change your life?,Oh yes.,Do you see,before you a better life?,I do.,Do you take it upon yourself,to afford that better life?,I do.,One world falls,away, another is taking shape.,When the,ordeal ends, who's there?,Nobody's there.,That's what Lizzie believed.,She began walking in the,direction of never coming back.,What was the meaning of,the thing that happened?,The thing that had been,like a tornado in her life.,It's something that will always follow,and the howling of its anger behind her,is something she will have to,relish as she moves forward.,Aiming so earnestly for,a future tense of joy.,Nice work getting,your degree, Angela.,I'm

The new face of corporate crime, Joe's bringing a Walmart mentality to small town America. His number two is Mike Milligan. Part enforcer, part detective, Mike is always smiling - but the joke is usually on you. Bulo and his crew have their sights set on the Gerhardt crime family in Fargo, currently led by matriarch Floyd Gerhardt. With her husband at death's door, Floyd takes over the family business, frustrating her eldest son, Dodd Gerhardt. An impatient hothead with a cruel streak to match his ambitions, Dodd can't wait for both his parents to die so he can take over and expand their business from kingdom to empire. Bear Gerhardt is the middle son, an intimidatingly large man who, although inarticulate, is the most decent of his clan. Rye Gerhardt, the youngest of the Gerhardt clan, views himself as a big shot, but in reality he's just a small dog who barks big.",,https://subslikescript.com/series/Fargo-2802850

            Do you consider the book,to be autobiographical?,Well, I mean...,...isn't everything autobiographical?,I mean, we all see the world,through our own tiny keyhole, right?,I mean, I always think,of Thomas Wolfe.,Have you ever seen that little,one-page ""Note to Reader""...,...in the front,of Look Homeward, Angel?,Anyway, he says that we are the sum,of all the moments of our lives...,...and anybody who sits down to write,will use the clay of their own life...,...that you can't avoid that.,So when I look at my own life,,I have to admit, right, that I...,

,I've never been around a bunch of guns,or violence, you know, not really.,No political intrigue,or a helicopter crash, right?,But my life, from my own point of view,,has been full of drama, right?,And so I thought,,if I could write a book...,...that could capture what it's like,to really meet somebody...,One of the most exciting things,that's happened to me...,...is to meet somebody,,make that connection.,And if I could make that valuable,,you know, to capture that...,...that would be the attempt, or...,Did I answer your question?,I'll try to be more specific.,Was there ever a French young woman,on a train you met...,...and spent an evening with?,See, to me, that...

,...that's not important, you know?,- So that's a yes?,All right, since I'm in France and this,is the last stop of my book tour, yes.,Thank you.,Mr. Wallace, the book ends,on an ambiguous note.,We don't know.,Do you think they get back together,in six months...,...like they promise each other?,Like they promised?,I think how you answer that,,you know, is...,It's a good test, right,,if you're a romantic or a cynic.,Right? I mean, you think,they get back together, right?,- You don't, for sure.,- No.,And you hope they do,,but you're not sure.,- That's why you're asking the question.,- Do you think they get back together?,I mean, did you in real life?,Did I in real...?,Look, in the words,of my grandfather, okay:,""To answer that would take,the piss out of the whole thing. "",We just have the time,for one last question.,What is your next book?,I don't know, man. I don't know.,I've been...,I've been thinking about this...,Well, I always kind of wanted,to write a book...,...that all took place,within the space of a pop song.,Like three or four minutes long,,the whole thing.,The story, the idea,,is that there's this guy, right...,...and he's totally depressed.,His great dream was to be a lover,,an adventurer, you know...,...riding motorcycles,through South America.,And instead he's sitting,at a marble table eating lobster.,He's got a good job and,a beautiful wife, right, but that...,Everything that he needs.,But that doesn't matter...,...because what he wants,is to fight for meaning.,You know? Happiness,is in the doing, right?,Not in the getting what you want.,So he's sitting there,,and just that second...,...his little 5-year-old daughter,hops up on the table.,And he knows that she should,get down, because she could get hurt.,But she's dancing to this pop song,in a summer dress.,And he looks down...,...and all of a sudden, he's 6.,And his high-school sweetheart,is dropping him off at home.,And they just lost their virginity,,and she loves him...,...and the same song is playing,on the car radio.,And she climbs up and starts dancing,on the roof of the car.,And now he's worried about her.,And she's beautiful, with a facial,expression just like his daughter's.,In fact, maybe that's why,he even likes her.,You see, he knows he's not,remembering this dance...,...he's there. He's there,,in both moments, simultaneously.,And just for an instant,,all his life is just folding in on itself.,And it's obvious to him,that time is a lie.,That it's all happening all the time...,...and inside every moment,is another moment...,...all happening simultaneously.,Anyway, that's kind of the idea.,Anyway.,Our author has to be going,to the airport soon...,...so thank you all very much,for coming over this afternoon.,And a special thanks to Mr. Wallace,for being with us.,Thank you. Thank you.,We hope to see you here again,with your next book.,Thank you all.

I'm just gonna go,get a cup of coffee.,- I'll be back at 7: 5.,- Did you sign all these?,- Yeah, I sure did.,- Get your driver Philippe's card...,...so you can call his cell,if you're running late.,We'll put your bags in the car,so you're not late.,- All right, thanks for everything.,- Thank you.,Which one's Philippe?,- I can't believe you're here.,- I live here in Paris.,Are you sure you don't have to stay?,You're not supposed to talk more?,They're sick of me.,I spent the night here.,- You did?,- Yeah, they got a loft upstairs.,- How are you? This is so weird.,- I'm fine.,- It's good to see you.,- It's good to see you.,- So you want to go to a caf??,- Yeah.,Okay. There's one a little further,that I like.,I thought I was gonna totally lose it,in there when I first saw you.,How did you know,I was gonna be here?,It's my favorite bookstore in Paris.,You can sit down for hours and read.,I love it. There's fleas,,but, you know...,I know. I think a cat slept,on my head last night.,I saw your picture on the calendar,about a month ago...,...and that you were going,to be here.,It's funny, because I read an article,on your book...,...and it sounded vaguely familiar.,- Vaguely? Yeah.,But I didn't put it all together,until I saw your photo. So...,Did you have a chance to read it?,Yes, I...,I was really, really surprised,,as you can imagine.,I mean, I had to read it twice, actually.,- Yeah?,- Yeah.,No, I liked it. It's very romantic.,I usually don't like that,,but it's really well-written.,- It's well-written. Congratulations.,- All right. Thank you.,- Wait.,- What?,Before we go anywhere,,I have to ask you...,Sure. What?,Did you show up in Vienna,that December?,- Did you?,- No, I couldn't. But did you?,- I need to know. It's important to me.,- Why, if you didn't?,Well, did you?,No.,Thank God you didn't.,- Oh, my God.,- Thank God you didn't.,Thank God I didn't and you didn't.,If one of us had showed up alone...,...that would have sucked.,- I was so concerned.,I felt horrible about not being there,,but I couldn't. My grandma died...,...and she was buried that day,,December 6th.,- The one in Budapest?,- Yes. You remember that?,- I remember everything.,- Of course, it was in your book.,But anyway, I was about to,fly to Vienna, you know...,...and we heard the news about her,,and of course I had to go to the funeral.,Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that.,I know. But you weren't there anyway.,Wait. Why weren't you there?,I would have been there,if I could have. I made plans...,You better have a good reason.,What?,Oh, no.,No, you were there, weren't you?,Oh, no, that's terrible!,I'm laughing, but I don't mean it.,Did you hate me?,You must've hated me.,- Have you been hating me all this time?,- No.,- Yes, you have.,- No.,But you can't hate me now, right?,- I mean, my grandma...,- I don't hate you. It's no big deal.,I flew all the way over there,,you blew the thing off.,My life's been a big nosedive since,,but it's not a problem.,- No, I'm kidding.,- Don't say that. I can't believe it.,You must have been so angry,with me. I'm so sorry.,I wanted to be there,,more than anything in the world.,- Honestly, I swear...,- You can't be angry, my grandmother...,I know. I honestly thought that something,like that might have happened.,I was definitely bummed, but...,Mostly I was mad we hadn't exchanged,any phone numbers or any information.,That was so stupid.,No way to get in touch.,- Nothing to go on.,- I didn't know your last name.,Remember, we were both afraid,if we started writing and calling...,...that it would slowly fade out.,- It definitely wasn't a slow fade.,No, it sure wasn't.,We wanted to pick up,where we left off.,Which would have been fine,if it had worked. Oh, well.,So...,- How long were you in Vienna, then?,- Just a couple days.,Did you meet another girl?,Yeah, her name was Gretchen,and she was amazing.,The book's really a composite,of the two of you.,No, I'm kidding. You wouldn't believe...,I even went back to the train station.,I put up signs of my number,in the hotel in case you'd been delayed.,- I was a total dork.,- Let's go this way. Did you get any calls?,Just a couple hookers,looking for a gig.,No, it was awful, I mean,,what do you want me to say?,It's so sad. I'm so sorry.,I walked around for a couple days.,Eventually, I flew home.,I owed my dad 2000 bucks...,...who had warned me,about French chicks.,What did he tell you,about French women?,Nothing. He's never met,any French women.,He's never been,east of the Mississippi.,Why didn't you put, ""Six months later,,the French bitch didn't show up""?,No, but I did, I did.,- You did?,- Yeah. No. I made it more hopeful.,I wrote this fictional version,where you do show up.,- Oh, what happens?,- Well...,What?,We make love for about 0 days straight,,that's one part of it.,- Interesting. So the French slut, right?,- Yeah, exactly.,It's just then they get,to know each other better...,...and realize they don't,get along at all.,- I like that. It's more real.,- My editor didn't think that way.,Everyone wants to believe in love.,It sells.,Yeah, exactly, so...,So things are going well for you,,right? I mean...,- Your book is a bestseller in the U. S.,- It's a tiny bestseller.,- Oh, come on.,- All right. Officially, yes.,Most people haven't read Moby Dick.,Why should they read my book?,I haven't read Moby Dick,and I liked your book.,- Thanks.,- Even though...,...I thought you idealized,the night of it.,Come on, it's fiction, right?,- I'm supposed to...,- I know, I know.,I know. I thought there were times,where you made me...,Well, I mean, her, right?,No, me. Okay, whatever.,- A little bit neurotic.,- You are a bit like that, aren't you?,- You think I'm neurotic?,- No, no, no. Come on, I'm kidding.,Where did I do that? I didn't do that.,Oh, maybe it's just me, you know...,Reading something, knowing,the character is based on you...,...it's both flattering and disturbing,at the same time.,How is it disturbing?,I don't know. Just being part,of someone else's memory.,Seeing myself through your eyes.,How long did it take you to write it?,Three or four years, on and off.,Wow, that's a really long time,to be writing about one night.,Yeah, I know. Tell me about it.,I always assumed,you had forgotten me.,No, I had a pretty clear picture,of you in my mind.,- I have to tell you something. I just...,- What?,I've wanted to talk to you for so long,that now... It's just surreal, you know?,I feel like everything should be...,How long do we have?,Twenty minutes and 30 seconds?,We got more than that.,I wanna know about you.,Tell me, what are you doing?,What are you up to?,Where to start? I work for Green Cross.,It's an environmental organization.,What are they all about?,We basically work on different,environment issues...,...from clean water to,disarmament of chemical weapons.,International laws that deal,with the environment.,- What do you do for them?,- We're going this way.,Different things.,Like, last year I was in India for a while,,working on a water-treatment plant.,Well, the cotton industry there,is a major source of pollution, so...,I mean, it sounds like you're actually,doing something.,Most people, myself included,,just sit around and bitch.,You know, how America's consuming,all the world's resources, SUVs suck...,...global warming is real...,I'm relieved to hear you're not one,of those ""freedom fries"" Americans.,Hey, you know...,But how'd you get into that?,I came out of political science,,hoping to work for the government.,- And I did for a little while. Terrible.,- Not good?,Yeah, no. Anyway, I got really tired...,Let's go this way.,Having this endless conversation,with friends...,...about how the world,was falling to pieces.,So I decided what I really,wanted to do was...,...to find things that could be fixed,and try to fix them, you know?,You know, I always thought you'd be,doing something cool like that. I did.,Thanks. I just feel really, really lucky,to be doing a job I like, you know?,Yeah.,I actually alternate in between thinking,everything is irrevocably screwed up...,...and things might be,getting better in ways.,Better? How could you,possibly say that?,Well, I just mean, you know, like...,I know it sounds weird, but there are,things to be optimistic about.,Okay... I know your book is selling,,which is great, I'm very happy for you.,But let me break the news to you:,The world is a mess right now.,From a Western view,,things are getting a bit better.,We're moving industry to developing,nations where we can get cheap labor...,...free of any environmental laws.,The weapon industry is booming.,Five million people die a year,from preventable water disease.,How is the world getting better?,I'm not angry, I'm not angry.,But come on, I want to know.,I'm interested.,I realize that there are a lot,of serious problems in the world.,- Okay. Thank you.,- I mean, I don't even have...,...one publisher in the Asian market.,- Okay. All right.,- Say stop.,- What? Stop.,Look, all I'm saying is there's more,awareness. People are gonna fight back.,The world might be getting better,because people like you...,...are educated and speaking out.,Even the very notion of conservation,,environmental issues...,...weren't in the vocabulary,till fairly recently.,And they're becoming the norm and,eventually might be what's expected.,I agree with what you're saying,,but at the same time it's dangerous.,An imperialist country can use,that kind of thinking...,...to justify their economic greed.,Is there any particular imperialist country,you have in mind, there, Frenchie?,- No, not really.,- No?,- So you wanna sit over there?,- Yeah, this is perfect.,Oh, wow. Maybe what I'm saying is...,...the world might be evolving,the way a person evolves.,Like, I mean, me, for example.,Am I getting worse?,Am I improving? I don't know.,When I was younger, I was healthier...,...but I was wracked with insecurity,,you know?,Now I'm older and my problems,are deeper...,...but I'm more equipped,to handle them.,So, what are your problems?,Right now I don't have any.,I don't, you know? I'm just...,...damn happy to be here.,Me too.,So how long have you been in Paris?,I got in last night.,I've done 0 cities in 2 days.,I'm wrecked. I'm so glad it's over,,you know?,I'm tired of being a huckster.,- Hi.,- Hello.,What do you want?,A cup of coffee.,God, I love this caf?. I wish they had,places like this in the U. S.,Yeah, I missed caf?s,when I was living over there.,I mean, I find a few places,I really liked, but there was...,- You were living in the U. S.?,- Yes, from '96 to '99.,I was studying at NYU.,Oh, God, don't tell me that, Celine.,- What?,- No, it's just...,- Nothing, I mean, I...,- What?,I've been living in New York since '98.,We were there at the same time.,- In New York?,- Yeah.,That's weird. It actually crossed my mind,a few times that I might run into you...,...but the odds are so slim, right? So...,I didn't even know,what city you were in.,- Weren't you somewhere in Texas?,- Yeah, yeah, definitely. I just...,I was for a long time. I just,,you know, wanted to try New York.,What brought you back here?,I had finished my master's, for one...,...and no visa, no more visa.,And I was starting to get paranoid.,All the violence in the medias:,Gang violence, murders,,especially serial killers...,But the final straw was...,...one night I heard some noise,on my fire escape...,...so I called 9,,and the cops came eventually.,- Like three hours later.,- Yeah, after I had been raped and killed.,No, but it was a man,and a woman officer.,I was explaining what I had heard...,...when the woman had,to go move the police car.,I was left alone with the male cop.,Right away he asked me if I had a gun,,and I said, ""No, of course not. "",And he told me, ""Well, you better,think about getting one.,This is America, not France. Okay?"",And I said to him, ""I have no idea,how to shoot a gun...,...and I have no interest,in firearms whatsoever. "",And that's when he pulled out his gun,,like this, and he went:,""Well, one day, you're gonna have,something like this in your face...,...and if you wanna have a long life...,...you're gonna have to choose,between you or them. "",And then they left. And the next morning,I called for an application to get a gun.,Me with a gun.,I mean, that's really scary.,But then I realized,something was wrong.,The way that cop had pulled his gun out,,and everything, right?,So I canceled my demand,for the gun...,...and I called the police and tried,to complain about that cop.,- What happened with that?,- It was so much paperwork...,...and then I got scared,,with my shitty student visa...,- Thought you'd get deported?,- Exactly. I gave up...,...and forgot about the whole thing.,- Well, I guess I never forgot.,- Obviously.,But still, you know,,I really enjoyed being there.,- There's lots of things I miss in the U. S.,- Yeah? Like what?,Well...,The overall good mood,people have there.,Like, even if it can be,bullshit sometimes.,Like, ""How you doing?"" ""Great. "",""How you doing?"" ""Great!"",""Have a great day!"",I don't know. Parisians can be,so grumpy. Have you noticed?,No, everybody seems,pretty happy to me.,- They're not happy. No.,- They're not happy?,No, they are. I don't know. I just,mean French men. They drive me nuts.,What is it? What about them?,Well, they're very nice.,They're great, you know, to be around.,They love food, wine,,they're great cooks.,But I've had really bad luck with them.,Why? What do you mean?,- Well, I guess they're not as...,- What?,What's the word?,- Horny? They're not as horny.,- Horny?,Wait, listen to me on this one. In that,regard, I am proud to be an American.,And you should be.,In that regard only.,Have you ever spent time,in Eastern Europe?,Eastern... No, I don't.,Thank you.,I remember as a teenager,I went to Warsaw...,...when it was still,a strict communist regime.,- Which I don't approve of at all.,- Sure you don't.,- No, I don't.,- I'm just kidding.,But anyway, something about,being there was very interesting.,After a couple of weeks,,something changed in me.,The city was quite gloomy and gray...,...but after a while,,my brain seemed clearer.,I was writing more,in my journal...,...ideas I'd never thought of before...,- Communist ideas?,- Listen, I'm not...,- I'm sorry, I...,- Okay.,- Go on.,Okay. I'll send you to a gulag later.,No. But it took me a while to figure out,why I felt so different.,One day, as I was walking,through the Jewish cemetery...,...I don't know why,,but it occurred to me there...,...I realized that I had spent the last,two weeks away from most of my habits.,TV was in a language,I didn't understand...,...there was nothing to buy,,no advertisements anywhere...,...so all I'd been doing was...,...walk around, think, and write.,My brain felt like it was at rest...,...free from the consuming frenzy.,It was almost like a natural high.,I felt so peaceful inside.,No strange urge to be somewhere else...,...to shop...,It could have seemed,like boredom at first...,...but it became very, very soulful.,It was interesting, you know?,Can you believe it was nine years ago,we were walking around Vienna?,- Nine years? No, that's impossible.,- No, it was. It feels like two months.,But it was summer '94.,Do I look any different?,I do?,I'd have to see you naked.,- What?,- I know, I'm sorry.,Your hair was different back then.,It was like...,- It's the same... Oh, down.,- Yeah, take it down.,Down. Okay, it was down. Okay.,Well? Voil?.,So?,Okay, come on. Tell me.,Skinnier, I think. A little thinner.,Did you think I was fat before?,- No...,- Yeah, you thought I was a fatty.,No, you thought I was a fatty. You,wrote a book about a fat French girl.,- No, listen.,- Oh, no.,Seriously, all right? You look beautiful.,Do I look any different?,No. Not at all.,Actually, you have this line.,- I know.,- It's like a scar.,- A scar? Like a gunshot wound?,- No, no, no. I like it. I'm sorry.,I had this funny...,Well, horrible dream the other day.,I was having this awful nightmare,that I was 32.,And then I woke up,,and I was 23. So relieved.,And then I woke up for real,,and I was 32.,- Shit, man. It happens.,- Scary.,Time goes faster and faster.,Apparently, it's because...,...we don't renew synapses after,our 20s, so it's downhill from then on.,I like getting older, you know?,Life feels...,I don't know, it feels more immediate.,Like I can appreciate things more.,No, me too, actually. I really love it.,I was once...,...a drummer in a band.,- You were?,- Yeah. We were pretty good, actually.,But the lead-singer guy, he was just so,obsessed with us getting a record deal.,It's all we talked about, thought about,,getting bigger shows.,Everything was just focused on,the future all the time. And now...,...the band doesn't even exist anymore.,And looking back,at the shows we did play...,...even rehearsing, it was just,so much fun.,I just... Now I'd enjoy every minute of it.,Could I have a drag of that?,Well, your book has been published.,That's a pretty big deal.,You've been all around Europe.,Are you enjoying every minute of it?,- Not really.,- Not really?,No.,- Do you have another one of those?,- Yes, of course.,Here.,In my field, I see these people that...,Oh, sorry.,Come into it with big,,idealist visions...,...of becoming the leader,that will create a better world.,They enjoy the goal,,but not the process.,- Right.,- But the reality of it is...,...the true work of improving things,is in the little achievements.,- That's what you need to enjoy.,- What do you mean, exactly?,I was working for this organization,that helped villages in Mexico.,And their concerns was how,to get the pencils...,...sent to the kid,in those little country schools.,It was not about big,,revolutionary ideas. It was about pencils.,I see the people that do the real work,,and what's really sad is that...,...the people that are,the most giving, hardworking...,...and capable of making,this world better...,...usually don't have the ego,and ambition to be a leader.,They don't see any interest,in superficial rewards.,They don't care if their name,ever appear in the press.,They actually enjoy the process,of helping others.,- They're in the moment.,- Yeah, but that's so hard...,...you know, to be in the moment.,I mean, I feel like I'm...,...designed to be slightly dissatisfied,with everything, you know?,It's like always trying,to better my situation.,I satisfy one desire,,and it just agitates another.,And then I think, to hell with it, right?,Desire's the fuel of life.,You know? Do you think it's true...,...that if we never wanted anything,,we'd never be unhappy?,I don't know. Not wanting anything,,isn't that a symptom of depression?,Yeah, that is, right?,I mean, it's healthy to desire, right?,Yeah. I don't know. It's what all,those Buddhist guys say, right?,Liberate yourself from desire,,and you'll find...,...you already have everything you need.,- But I feel alive...,...when I want something more,than basic survival needs.,Wanting, whether it's intimacy,with another person...,...or a pair of shoes, is beautiful.,I like that we have those,ever-renewing desires, you know?,Maybe it's this sense,of entitlement.,You know, like whenever you feel like,you deserve that new pair of shoes?,It's okay to want things, as long as you,aren't pissed off if you don't get them.,Life's hard. It's supposed to be.,If we didn't suffer, we wouldn't,learn a thing, you know?,So, what, are you Buddhist,,or something?,- No.,- No? Why not?,I don't know. The same reason I don't,really consider myself anything, really.,I decided a long time ago that,I was gonna be open to everything...,...but not buy into any one,and only belief system.,I went to this Trappist monastery,a couple years ago.,- Trappist?,- Yeah, they're Catholic. Cistercian.,- Why did you do that?,- Why? I'd been doing some reading.,Thought it'd be cool. Have you ever,spent any time with monks or nuns?,- No. It's not really my style.,- No?,Well, I expected them to be all,glowering and stern, but they weren't.,They were quick to laugh,,really easy to be around.,Seriously, very attuned to everything,,they were just...,You know, they weren't trying,to hustle anybody.,They're trying to live and die,in peace with God...,...or whatever part of them,they feel is eternal.,It was just so refreshing to be around.,You realize that most,of the people that you meet...,...are trying,to get somewhere better.,They're trying to make more cash,,get a little more respect...,...have more people admire them.,It's exhausting.,- No kidding.,- And it's exhausting to be one yourself.,There I am, right, you know,,all greedy to be more spiritual.,""I want to be a better person,"",you know? You can't escape.,I had this boyfriend of mine many years,ago that wanted to be a Buddhist.,So he went to Asia to visit some,of those monasteries.,- I've thought about doing that too.,- Yeah, you should. I'll tell you why.,He was good-looking, and each time,he went to one of the monasteries...,...a monk offered to suck his cock.,True story.,It all comes down to that, doesn't it?,That's why I really admire,what you're doing.,- You know?,- What do you mean? Sucking cock?,- No.,- No? Wrong answer.,No, I was gonna say,you're not detached from life.,You're putting your passion into action.,Well, I try.,You know something?,I'm gonna be on planes...,...and in an airport,for the next eight hours...,I'd just love to see,a little bit more of Paris.,- Would you walk with me?,- Yeah.,- Do you mind?,- That's great.,- Do you want to?,- Let's do that. Yeah.,What do we owe here?,Four-fifty?,No, I got it, I got a little,per diem going on here.,- This good, for a tip?,- Yeah, that's fine.,- That's more than enough.,- Throw that in too.,- Is there anywhere to go around here?,- It's sales day today.,- What's that?,- It's when everything's on sale in Paris.,It's twice a year.,All right, let's go shopping.,No, no, no. That's a bad idea.,I don't wanna inflict that on you.,It's madness. Let's just go,to this garden path. It's really nice.,All right.

Philip Guston: A Life Lived (1981) - full transcript,"Philip Guston is a powerful staple of the abstract expressionist movement, though he would prefer it be referred to as the New York School. Along with composers, choreographers and his fellow visual artists, Guston found his place in the avant garde. Often times finding modern art almost too accessible, Guston strives to create pieces that encourage audiences to engage, but not without deep consideration. His paintings rely heavily on motif and repetition, emphasizing the importance of his often political subjects. Perhaps his own worst critic, Guston had a habit of destroying the work he did not find himself connecting with. Guston had no interest in simply presenting an image that he was not fully absorbed in. His passion for his work comes through in heavy brush strokes which turn and travel expressively across the canvas. In reference to his own process and the diversity within his work Guston tell us ""Nothing is ever solved in painting. It's a continuous chain that sometimes doesn't go in one line, but goes in a serpentine line or in crooked paths, detours, which have to be investigated."" (Philip Guston) In both his paintings and career Guston did not fear exploration but welcomed it, eagerly following the winding path of his ever evolving art.","

            - [Philip] One always,quarrels with what one is.,I'm a modern painter, I suppose.,My quarrel with modern painting is that,I feel that much of modern painting,,in fact, perhaps some,of my early work too,,that it was too easy to,illicit a response, you know.,Painters could put down,some swatches of color,,and everybody responds, I,mean needs so much sympathy.,It has such a sympathetic audience.,I think I wanted more and,more specificity in the work.,There's too much of a love,affair in modern art, you know.,

,
,- I have a personal question,which I don't expect you to answer,,but I am fascinated wondering what,happened between 1962 and 1969,,particularly in 1964, '65.,- Same thing that happened in 1930.,What do you mean, to my painting?,- [Interviewer] Yeah.,- I think when I paint,this, or that, or that,,I'm still in 1940,or '50, or in the '50s, yeah.,I mean I don't know what I'm going to do.,I mean, many of these pictures have many,pictures underneath that,have been scraped out,,

,as the older ones do.,The appearance may change.,That's why the comments about,style sound strange to me.,You work in this style or in that style,as if you had a choice in the matter.,What you're doing is trying to stay alive,and continue and not die.,Therefore,,it's circular, you're still back there.,I don't feel any differently now,than I did in the early,'50s when I was doing,so-called non-figurative things.,I know that they're,dissolved and they don't,have this figuration and all that,,but that's really beside the point.,Because what is to the point is the...,that I'm in the same state.,- But altered slightly.,- But?,Yeah, but that's not my business.,- [Interviewer] Manifestations too.,- The rest is not my business.,All I want to do stay that state,,the rest is not my business.,- Well actually I've known,Philip's work for a long time.,Back when I was a student,at the Art Institute of,Chicago in the 1940's,I first saw paintings by Philip Guston,in the old Chicago annuals and,the American shows at that time.,That was before abstract expressionism,,just after World War II.,And so I was aware of Guston,,I wasn't aware of his,history or where he came from,or anything else but simply,by looking at paintings,like Martial Memory I felt that's,exactly the way I wanted to work,,because it was the advanced,painting of the time.,And then I was called into the service.,And when I was gone from 1952 to 1954,,it was during that period of,time that museums began to,pay a great deal of attention,to the new abstract painters,,to Pollock, to Kline, to,Guston, the whole bunch of 'em.,So when I came back to,school for my masters degree,,what had been the old Guston was gone,and what was the new Guston was there.,But his particular kind,of abstract expressionism,,or abstract impressionism,,whatever you want to call it,,the colors were so attractive,,the whole thing related in some,vague way to the late Monet,,and you could feel an,historical attachment.,I then, I would say in fairness,,I lost track again, as everyone did.,We got involved with the Jasper Johnses,and the Robert Rauschenbergs,and the Frank Stellas,and a few other of the early '60s artist.,But I wondered always what he was doing.,And when the Marlborough,show happen in 1970,,I think it was a shocker,for all of us in a way.,Not so much a shocker,for me because I knew,,consciously knew, his work,of the 1930s and the 1940s,where not dissimilar things appeared.,The young boys in cardboard,hats and newspaper hats,and fighting with wooden,swords weren't too far away,from the kind of rendering of,the new Ku Klux Klan painting.,The whole sense of them is so tough,and so strong at a time,when painting generally,appeared to have the signs at least,that it was getting burned,out one way or another.,To see one of the old-timers,come back with this kind of vigor,at that point in his,life was irresistible.,Though I admit that at,that time I did not know,that back in the 1930s he had been dealing,with the Ku Klux Klan in quite a different,way than at the Marlborough show.,I will admittedly say that as,the painting went on to the '70s,,the shock of the early,Marlborough paintings,was nothing compared to,what happened after that.,- They really are.,(laughing),- Go ahead, Philip.,- Remy was saying that and,I didn't believe it was so.,Good to see you.,- Good to see you.,You look great.,(mumbling),Put on a little weight.,- That was the food on the plane.,- Yeah, bologna. (laughs),Isn't that nice?,- I haven't seen this in 25.,- [Henry] I know, so,did I, isn't that funny?,Memory does wonderful things.,- Well it hadn't been mounted.,This is the one show I can touch pictures,and nobody's gonna tell me nothing.,- But when you painted that picture,that was a very big picture,when you painted it.,- Yeah.,Gee, had that always been mounted?,- [Henry] They're in pretty good shape.,They're in pretty good shape, yeah.,They got the frame on,the Mother and Child.,- Yeah, the Mother and Child.,I was 17 years old.,I was studying the Renaissance painting,,as well as De Chirico and,the Picasso of the '20s.,Well, you have to come from somewhere.,You don't come out of the sky.,Holy Moses!,- You ready?,- Jesus!,- For the power base.,- Oh, here's the knockout.,- You're exactly right.,Like two different shows, Philip.,- [Philip] Yeah, this is a knockout.,- [Henry] Like two different shows.,- [Philip] It's overwhelming, Henry.,- [Henry] Yes, it is overwhelming.,- I don't know how much,more I can take of it.,Marvelous.,Are you happy?,- [Henry] Oh, I'm very happy.,- [Philip] How's Jan?,- [Henry] She's in great shape.,She's in great shape.,- What's been on my mind, you ask,,this last decade say, but,primarily the last five,,six years is the...,for me, the cruciality of a contest,,(stammering),to me, every painter or artist has his,own temperament, of course,,and my temperament seems to need,or I'm not happy, not happy, not involved,,unless I have...,I call it a contest.,Contest between a subject,and the plastic form it will result in.,And the reason I enjoy the contest is,that this contest between,the means of painting,,I mean scale, distances,,locations, spaces.,- Surfaces.,- Surfaces,,color, that's right,,thin or thick and so on.,Leads, since I constantly,change on a single painting,,I mean scrape out and,repaint a lot as you know,,leads to structures which are surprising.,I was born in Montreal, Canada.,At a very early age,family moved to Los Angeles, California,where I was reared,until about the age of 18,when I left for New York.,The earliest contact with,an art school was about,I think the age of, perhaps 16 or 17.,An art school in California,where I'd won a scholarship,,but I couldn't afford,to stay in art school.,(stapler smacking),I had to work for a living.,I worked at odd jobs at the time.,I'd drove trucks, I worked,in a cleaning plant,,doing all sorts of things,,and painted at night and weekends.,I started drawing and painting,when I was about 11 or 12.,Well in the west coast,,I mean in Los Angeles,,there was very little by way,of any excitement in art.,There were, they used to call it,,I think the Eucalyptus School of Painting,,landscape painters and so on.,It's not at all what it is today.,However, there was one,source of inspiration.,There was a doctor Walter Aaronsberg,,who had perhaps the only,collection of modern art there,,and it was a very good collection.,It was a collection that he commissioned,Marcel Duchamp to collect for him.,It was the first time I had,seen Picassos and Mir?s,,Brancusi, Klee, the whole school of Paris,modern movement was available,to me for the first time.,I was mostly struck by De Chirico.,They hit me very hard, in fact,,it was seeing these,paintings by De Chirico,,it's what made me to want to,be a painter, not resolve.,I thought as if I had come home.,A high school friend was Jackson Pollock,and my memory is of going,with Jack, he was Jack then,,to old secondhand book shops and fighting,each other to buy old Dial magazines.,There was like you'd find,,I suppose in any province,,a small group, sort of an underground,group of young painters and,politically interested people,and poets and writers and musicians.,This was a small rebellious group,,which we were interested,in all the advanced forms,of poetry and painting,then which would come to us,by way of magazines and reproductions,,never an original exhibition.,And we decided to do a group of frescoes,on the Scottsboro case, which,was a hot case at that time.,You remember the Scottsboro?,Nine black boys who were sentenced,for life for raping a white girl.,And it was all circumstantial evidence.,So we did a series of frescoes,on the Scottsboro case,,which was shown at the John Reed Club,which was in North Hollywood at that time.,The KKK, which was very,strong in LA at that time,had an immense membership.,And they just with lead pipes and guns,shot through the eyes of the black guy,being whipped by a clansmen.,I just thought I'd give you,the way it was then in LA.,About 1935 or '36 I went to New York.,I came to New York and,I saw those brick walls.,I felt as if I had come home.,I remember going to the,first artist union meeting,with 2,500 painters and sculptures.,I thought, this was incredible.,Pollock and his brother had gone,to New York the year before.,So I when I first arrived in New York,I lived with them in their,loft on eighth street.,And then gone on the federal,art projects in New York,,on the mural part of it.,It was, to follow up from,the Aaronsberg collection,,it was the first time I was exposed,to galleries and the museums in New York.,My painting kept changing,,constantly being influenced,by what I was seeing.,In one of the last murals I had painted,,a part of this mural which,was a section which depicted,some children, young children,fighting on the street,with ashcans and various pieces,of lumber and sticks and so on,,and some reason or another,this struck a chord in me.,For the next six years or so I painted,a number of easel paintings,of this subject, of children.,I remember destroying the,whole group of pictures,in the latter part of this period,because they didn't ring true to me,,and it was a sure sign to me,that I wasn't involved with it,,and I was using the subject,as an excuse to make pictures,,and nothing is more boring,in the world than to make pictures.,What you want is an,experience of making something,that you haven't seen before in that way.,I was studying Piero, obviously,,but when I reached the,bottom in working with this,,I had a year in which I,kept destroying paintings.,I've told this to Henry.,Because I didn't want,to paint the subject.,Actually I was getting,through with this subject.,- [Henry] Yeah, right.,- When I reached down here,,and I started to paint,,and suddenly I didn't feel,it, it wasn't real to me,,like If This Be Not I or Martial Memory.,So then I realized, well,,relationships have a different,meaning and that's why...,- [Henry] Look at that and this.,- And that came next,,but it was a year later.,And that's what happened.,I felt good about this.,It felt, well not that it was abstract,,but that it was moving to a place,I didn't know where I was,going and that's what I enjoy,,of not knowing where you're moving.,'Cause that's full of,potential, of course.,But you know those are,still the hooded figures.,So when I reached this point,,I went to Europe for the first time.,I was on a c.r.e.t.a. Rome.,I faked it.,I got a c.r.e.t.a. Rome by,submitting these pictures.,I just wanted to wander the streets alone,think about painting.,I knew I was headed for a change,,I didn't know where or what.,I didn't just stay in in Rome,,that's when I traveled all over and saw my,pantheon of painters for,the first time in the flesh,,I mean Piero, Masaccio, De Sanctis.,I drew out of the hotel rooms,and I did a lot of drawings like that.,And then I came back in,'49 and began painting,as if I were just beginning to paint.,From '49 for me up until say '55,was this very intense,active period in New York,of what's called the New York school.,Which I much prefer and I think many,of my contemporaries prefer that term,to the term abstract expressionist,because it simply defines a,place and a certain period,where a number of,artists, for many reasons,,were together at one time.,De Kooning, I knew on the WPA projects,,on the federal art projects.,Rothko and Motherwell,,I'd met at that time.,Barney Newman, we all,electrified each other.,I know what I ate that day,,you know the lunch I ate,,when the picture finally came off.,- [Woman] Is that true?,- Sure, and I can remember stories.,When this picture came off,in the old Cedar Bar days,,about three in the morning,,I was on 10th Street,,you know the artists' plot.,- [Woman] Yes.,- I go into Cedar bar and Bill Kooning's,at the bar with Franz Kline.,I'd been on it for, I don't,know, two or three weeks,and finally came off.,All the surround are just,,they're erasures of other forms.,I had this look on my face,,and Bill says, looks at me, he said,,""Good strokes, son.,""You made some good strokes."",(laughing),So, I mean, I remember all these,little intimate details,about each picture.,It seems like every five or six,years or something like that,I begin feeling that,I've exhausted something,and gradually move into another thing.,Dissatisfaction entered,in to the work you've,done for the past five years.,Not that problems have to be solved,,because nothing is ever,solved in painting.,It's a continuous chain that sometimes,doesn't go in one line but,goes in a serpentine line,or in the crooked paths, detours,,which have to be investigated.,I felt like an explorer who almost,got to the top of Mount Everest,and somehow stopped just,short and remembered,,and thought 'Well, perhaps,,maybe I forgot some gear'.,'I forgot some equipment'.,But in going down to,recover this equipment,I took some side paths that looked,exciting and full of possibilities.,What equipment did I lack?,It was a stronger contact with,the thickness of things.,I suppose I was reacting,against being too imaginative,and wanted everything to come from things.,The graining of wood,,the feeling of stone,,the corruption of the world,,the violence in the world.,Nothing new at all.,I wanted it to be more like,the art of the past that I liked.,I mean a Mantegna painting,doesn't care if 500,spectators fall off a,cliff, you know it's there.,And so it goes.,In my loft, when I lived in New York,,and had this hundred foot grimy loft,full of crap and junk and so on,,over a firehouse, in Chelsea.,I hadn't painted for about two months.,Didn't feel like it.,My painting was beginning to bore me,,I mean what I'd been doing.,I stretched up a 10 foot canvas,,not on a stretcher, I painted on the wall,,on the partition wall.,And squeezed out tons of paint.,Oh, I'll paint the room.,I'll paint all this junk.,I had an eight hour stint.,I painted the cracked and broken mirror,and the paint table with paint,on the floor scraped out,,you know the oil, dirty,,you know, a New York loft.,Useless wires hanging down.,And other easels and stacked up drawing.,I painted like my eye, I,looked, I didn't think at all.,I painted the whole thing.,In fact I ended up,about eight, nine hours.,I look back and I thought,,well, Jesus, I'm a painter.,It looked like a Bonnard or, you,know... it was really wonderful,,a lot of colors and everything.,I was doing these black pictures then,,the beginnings of these,dark, heavy, black pictures.,We lived across the,street and I woke up Musa,about four in morning, I said,,you gotta look at this.,And of course she came over and she said,,""Gee, it's wonderful"".,Then I couldn't sleep 'cause,I thought what's happening?,Am I going to have a,new career as a painter?,Is my painting changing?,Does this deny all my previous work?,You know?,To make the story short,,when I came in the next,morning to look at it,,my euphoria was gone, just disappeared.,The painting itself looked as,if I could just peel it off.,Didn't stick.,And naturally, I destroyed it.,This desire for more solid forms,continued all into the early '60s,with these more or less ambiguous images,but they were very solid,,these black pictures.,And more and more desire grew to make,them even more objective,and even recognizable.,After I had the exhibition,of this work in '66,,I started drawing a lot.,Such as the books on the table,or the clock hanging on the,wall, or my shoe on the floor.,It felt free somehow to make,it a recognizable object,painted as if I was seeing,the object for the first time.,Unconsciously as I look,back on my old work,,on this early work now,,it's as if I was preparing,the scenario, so to speak,,unconsciously, I didn't,know what I was doing.,But these fragmentary pictures,were all later incorporated,into the large work.,For instance, these are,very early drawings of books,that I did years ago.,Which I wanted to get the,thickness and solidity of the.,These led into, as you,can see in the back here,,some paintings of books,,some small paintings of books.,They kept changing their,forms as I worked into them.,They became stone tablets.,Something like this became,like some ancient manuscript,or something like that.,This is a recent one,,which I wanted to give,the feeling of an old, crumpled, book,that had been in existence,for thousands of years.,Then I began drawing,,this is a very early drawing.,I began drawing a subject which I,dealt with many years ago,of the hooded figures.,They're obviously...,based on Ku Klux Klan figures.,But I didn't mean to make a,story about the Ku Klux Klan.,I'm just using them as a, I,suppose you'd call it a symbol,,of hooded, masked figures.,- [Interviewer] I guess the,violence of those years.,- Oh, yes.,Oh, indeed.,You mean politically speaking here?,Very definitely had a big influence on me.,- [Interviewer] What in particular?,- Everything.,The war, the political conventions,,the state of the world, everything.,I don't think it's limited,just to America, either,,I mean the violence in the world,ever since I've been alive.,Which everyone experiences that.,I moved away from New York in '67.,Upstate, about 100 miles upstate.,My productivity increased.,In New York you gotta go to openings,,the social life, it's too much.,You know time I've learnt, is,not actual time for an artist,,it's continuity of time.,So if I can have months of just,nothing pulling on me,,nothing ahead or anything,,it's wonderful time because you continue,from you paint all night, and then sleep,,then you can paint.,You know what I mean, you continue.,In New York I couldn't.,I was on a crest of the wave when,that finally broke about '68.,My old interests came surging back.,I felt like Fellini.,I felt like a movie director.,I had to make memos to myself.,Have 'em around a table playing poker,,have 'em drinking beer, eating hamburgers,,you know some are riding cars.,I was attacked, you,know, that goes with it.,I'm used to it.,Like at the opening of,the Marlborough show,when I did those hoods there,,I mean the painters would come up to me,,I remember I don't have to name them,,and they'd say, ""Phil, what did you have,""to go and do that for?"",Well you have no idea how,opinionated people are or.,Oh, the fine hatchet jobs were done on me.,It bothered me the, you know,,what's happened to this painter?,He was such a nice painter.,I mean John Cage said you were living,such a beautiful country.,He hated the new work, Cage did,,together with other people.,I mean some painters,that I'd known for years,wouldn't even talk to me,,like I had entered into a covenant,in a church, and I was,being excommunicated.,Bill Kooning put it a better way.,He said, ""What do they think,,we're all on a baseball team?"",(laughing),Bill said what's all this nattering,about figuration and politics.,He says it's about freedom!,So you know, embraced, kissed each other,,and said of course, the,first thing an artist,,his only possession is freedom finally.,That sounds easy, doesn't it?,But it's rough.,(scraping),You know that story about,someone who knew a child,and had seen the child when he's an adult.,Says, my, how you've changed.,The child doesn't feel he's changed,in that 20 years or 15 years.,He's the subject.,I am the subject.,The first thing always looks good,and then you start doubting it, you know.,Very nice.,Fronts.,Here, this arched one is nice.,I used to draw these and,paint them years ago.,I used to put them in paintings,,as a background I'd put in those windows.,I love old brick buildings anyway,,particularly the river,,Hudson River buildings.,Well it hasn't changed at all,since the turn of the century.,I just like the looks of it.,Actually I also like the fact it's old,and that it's uninhabited.,I've done drawings of this.,Something about the fact,that it's not used anymore,fascinates me, in other words,,it's original intention has vanished,so that it exists now as a kind of object,,like a work of art, it,has no function whatsoever,and that fascinates me.,What do you like about,the building, Clark?,Those metal stars?,- Any metal attached to this brick,is kinda fascinating.,- Yeah, I know.,- [Clark] The rust.,I like the way things decay.,- [Philip] He's a poet.,He can say it better than I can.,Looks like a jail too.,- Yeah, it does.,- Oh, no, Philip.,- [Philip] No?,- [Woman] A jail wouldn't,have those nice eyebrows.,(laughing),- [Philip] That's what they are.,Eyebrows with teeth.,- If you look at a lot of these,it's almost like a movie in a way.,- You mean the sequence?,- [Clark] Yeah, the way it is here.,I don't know how it would be singly.,- One of the hooded figures,all like he just dipped his,,the jam smeared all over him or something.,I like this one.,The back of the head like a real,,almost half vegetable, half root.,Huh?,- [Clark] Rock too.,- Half rock or root or,something like that.,I wanted like a really a,bunch of dumb creatures.,They're really dumb, just dumb creatures.,I mean the world we live in, you know?,(laughs) The real world.,Well somebody was here the other day who,had these kinda thoughts,,this wasn't as good as.,I really wanted to kick him out.,I thought, you really don't know...,You really don't know how it works.,That's just not the way the thing works.,- [Clark] You mean he came in,here and he looked at all this,and he said this isn't as good as?,- [Philip] That's right.,Or not as good as something,I painted last year or.,If the artist starts evaluating himself,it's an enormous block, isn't it?,- [Clark] Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.,- [Interviewer] Do you think of yourself,as kind of pessimistic in attitude,,in terms of say the large,subject of your art?,I don't know if maybe that's,too large to talk about.,- I don't think it was pessimistic.,Think it's doomed. (laughs),I don't mean I consciously,set out to paint doom.,- [Interviewer] Is that an aspect,of say the modern condition then?,- Yes.,Yes, I think so.,- [Interviewer] 'Cause,you feel you've lived it.,- I think so.,Then quite a number of paintings,in the last five, six years,are my impulse in doing them,were quite frankly, autobiographical.,I mean I was quite conscious.,Autobiographical in a,sense, to be very specific,,two or more years ago Musa,,my wife, had a minor stroke.,She was in the hospital for quite a while.,I became obsessed with her situation.,She became a kind of symbol,,just the top of her head,,her hair parting off to the horizon.,I'm quite aware that,what I'm doing there is,using specific, in that case,specific subject matter.,Look what Henry did.,Very nice.,He puts a Coats picture.,But you can gather them, the two together.,Then the Musa, as he calls 'em, pictures.,This one, that one, and this one.,Musa As Horsehoes.,- [Henry] And this one.,- And this one.,Sure!,It was you, then it became a horseshoe,,and then it became you again.,- [Henry] Then a sun and a wheel and a.,- That's right!,Was there ever a painter who,thought he could make a picture,,I'm not being vain, but I mean,,I was so amused in painting this.,It was gonna be another leg picture.,You can tell because I,painted out the repeated legs.,Then I put a door in and then,fanciful bugs parading below.,They're stamping bugs there.,Well that's a human,thing.,- Concern.,- We always stamp bugs out, right?,But it can become a painting.,So art can be anything, right?,- [Henry] Yeah, that's right, yes.,- [Interviewer] You talked,earlier of Musa's situation,,how did your own recent,illness affect your work?,- When I came home from the hospital,I wanted to paint a man dying because,that's what had happened to me,,I mean that was my own experience,with this heart attack.,But I was reading the Four,Quartets at the same time.,It's a late Eliot work and,I like the Four Quartets.,I was aware as I was doing it,,I didn't want to do a self-portrait,,too obvious and it wasn't,right for me to do that.,I certainly in the,middle of it became aware,this looked like Eliot,,and the reason for the ear,,which is extended like a Buddha ear,was because I just happened,to know that Eliott,became very interested in,his later years in buddhism.,I mean that's the reason for it.,- [Interviewer] And this is you at work?,- Well.,- More or less.,- [Philip] The artist, yeah.,- [Interviewer] The artist at work.,- [Philip] That's right.,And the big fat brushes that are.,- [Interviewer] His tools,in front of.,- His tools,,that's right pallette.,- [Interviewer] And a few,piles of paint, right?,- [Philip] That's right.,This is paint down here.,- [Interviewer] And the bugs.,- Yeah, it's a discovered picture,,I mean it's one of those pictures,that are found in the painting for me.,I don't know when I do a thing like that,I'm aware that it's some kind of bug.,I mean the impulses make,some kind of insect,,but I don't know what kind or.,I'm sure there isn't an insect,that's formed like that, I don't know.,Or I don't even know what that is exactly.,I know this is a stone,,I meant it to be a stone.,Once I moved into here,,I just naturally wanted to have some kind,of creature looking over.,It was fun to paint.,Huh?,- [Interviewer] You didn't,feel compelled to complete,the other side of the ravine there?,- No.,You mean this part?,Oh, no, that's open.,You gotta have that.,It's amazing the more picture,painted itself in this case.,But the more you're in it,,the more that simultaneity occurs.,(stammering),I mean I'm very aware that while,the brushes are moving this way,,and I wanted this to move this way.,I mean there's this impulse that's...,I don't like the word spontaneous,but it is in a way, instincts,,that having things move,opposite directions,and up and down and so on.,I mean once the moon was,here it would look terrible.,It just felt wrong.,And then I put it there,at the very end, even cut off, felt right.,I think once I said something,to quote myself many years ago,I remember that, I was,talking to John Cage actually,,I said, when you go in the studio,,everybody is in the studio, your friends,,and art writers and the museum people,,they're all in the studio,,you're just there painting.,One by one they leave.,You see, that's what I told John.,One by one they leave,until you're really alone.,That's what painting is.,You wait and you prepare yourself,to be when there's nobody there,,and then ideally you leave.,- [Interviewer] I was just gonna ask you.,- Ideally you leave.,- [Interviewer] And then somebody,stays behind and does the painting.,- That's right.,A third hand does it, that's right.,But it's no different than...,I think Stravinsky said that,he didn't write Rites of Spring,,it wrote itself through him.,Well, that's not a ""why"" statement,,it's a realistic concrete statement.,In other words you feel,as if you're not through,until you feel as if you're a medium,through which this,rhythm is passed through.,Otherwise it's unbearable.,Otherwise it's wax museum.,I was thinking about, not legs,,I mean they're just the excuse.,Well I was thinking about,,actually when it came off,,I enjoyed the fact that,the top becomes like a top,,like a table top, a level.,I really enjoyed myself painting this.,With the openings, you,know where you open it,,where you jam it up.,I mean you're dealing with forces.,And suddenly these are,charging and this is dangling,like a pendulum, you know.,And here it's gathering,force like charging out.,The idea of, yeah,,of a completely separate organism,,an organism like you'd,find in life, in nature,,which has its own energy,,energies, diverse energies.,I like the fact that it's,happening in front of you,rather than, I think in that case,,it feels as if you had just come in,on something that's already happened.,It's already happened.,But this is in the midst of,happening, which excites me.,- It's got nothing to,do with feet and shoes.,- Nothing.,Nothing at all.,Am I glad you said that.,I've been hearing enough about it,from people who talk about feet and legs,and shoes and, ugh!,- What the painting is all about,,it seems to me is right here.,Don't you say?,- You're very savvy.,That's what Meyer Schapiro,,who's a close friend,,you know the artist?,When he saw this picture he said, Philip...,I said absolutely, Meyer.,Those little openings.,Otherwise, you couldn't breathe.,It would be unbearable.,When you said that's it, you bet.,When I started this,painting a few days ago,,it went alright, it was,almost finished in a day.,But I came in later that night and,,well, I liked the left part,,didn't like the right part.,So I started changing the right part.,Something happened which felt better,to me than the left part.,So then I changed the left part,and before I knew it, the,whole painting vanished.,The painting that was almost finished here,didn't look bad, it looked alright.,But it looked almost too good.,It's as if I hadn't,experienced anything with it.,It was too much of a painting.,I hadn't experienced enough on it.,I don't mean that I need,to struggle always with it.,I don't mean that exactly.,But it looked too pat,,if you know what I mean.,It looked too much like it felt to me,as if it were additions, this,and that and that and that.,Whereas what I'm always seeking is some,great simplicity where the,whole thing is just there,and can't be this and,that and that and that.,There's something deathlike,about a painting finished.,A kind of death happens and...,I then am inclined to destroy it.,Destruction of paintings is very,interesting to me and almost crucial.,Sometimes I find that what,I've destroyed five years ago,I'll paint now,as if when the thing first appears,you're not ready to accept it either.,There's some mysterious,process at work here,which I don't even want to understand.,I know that if I stop painting,and became a psychologist,of the process of making,,I would probably understand it more,,but it wouldn't do me any good.,I don't want to understand,it like that, analytically.,But I know that there's some working out,that takes place in time,,but it's not given to me to,completely understand it.,It's illegal.,One could argue that a,picture where you pause,and say well that's my conviction,at this time is a compromise,,'cause then you go on to future pauses.,That's when you stop.,That's when a pictures finished.,So in other words, all,your work is one picture.,But then it has to do with continuity,,I mean who's life, in,other words continuing.,Because if you stop, you're wax museum.,I mean if you say well that's it,,then that's the wax museum idea.,So I think it has to do with,the gas not running out,,or might have to do with fear of death.,I don't know.,Or you know, wanting to continue.,I realize in looking at the show,,Musa and I were talking,about it at the hotel,this morning 'cause we saw it yesterday,,that's why I said it's,not so much a painting,,well it's a painting,show, but it's a life.,It's like a life lived.,I'm curious about what,I'm going to do always.,I'm just curious.,And curious about failures.,Curious about non-failures,,or less failures.,I feel I've opened up a Pandora's box,of imagery and structures and so on.,I'm still dreaming about pictures,that want to paint and going to paint,and I do a lot of sketching.,It feels endless.,- 500 years from now,in the history of art,,if you could be remembered,for just one thing,what would you like it to be?,- What would I like it to be?,- [Interviewer] What,do you hope it will be?,- You mean as a painter?,- [Interviewer] In your work.,- I never thought of that but,I want to be in the same,place that Goya went to.,That Manet went to.,That Cezanne went to.,And I wouldn't mind a pat,on the back by them saying,,""Not bad, Sonny."",That's about all.,(laughing),'Pas mal.',(laughing),The most you can do is try.,And I don't think it's courage,and all those nice words.,In fact one could make a,list of all the negative,things that would be more true to say,about being compelled,to continue painting.,They would include things,like boredom, disgust,,all the things you're not,supposed to think about.,It's not inspiration.,Inspiration is like for a minute but.,Anger, I mean lots of things that,you're not supposed to feel.,(laughing),The best thing I can say about summing up.,I don't like that word summing up.,Summing.,Things are constantly opening up for me.,All these pictures to me are still open,,I mean they might develop.,You know, one thing is,true which will illustrate,perhaps a little more clearly,what I'm talking about,,is that when you've had to,your run in the painting,and you feel okay about it,,it's both your friend and enemy.,By enemy, I mean you want to do it again.,I've been more productive,these last 10 years,than I've ever been in my painting life.,I don't feel finished so,it's hard for me to sum up,except to say that I wish I were painting,what I'm painting now being 30 years old.,I love painting.,I mean painting is my life.,Painting is what I live for.

I can't do it, Boss.,They're monsters.,Withdraw... withdraw,,both of you, remember that.,Come on. Really?,These two people...,only took 5 years,to grow this strong.,What's going on?,With the look of Gin's successor.,I suspect you ate Gin.,Do you want to get the lead,while I'm absent?,What?,Get the lead after Gin's dead?

I can't think of,anybody like Freddy.,

,He's kind of the rock star of boogeymen.,I think Freddy was to dreams,what Jaws was to swimmers.,It is so on the surface scary, it is so scary when,you think about who he is and where he comes from.,He was this child molester, you know, that,the parents came after him and they burned him.,And then he comes back,and kills what they love.,Freddy makes no apologies,,Freddy is on a revenge motif.,Freddy Krueger has a plan,,Freddy Krueger has a reason.,He is a metaphysical monster.,He moves into our dreams.,He doesn't have any time and space limitation.,That's what makes Freddy a little more fun to watch.,The ""Nightmare"" movies were more,complicated and ambitious.,It's different from ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"",or ""Halloween"" or ""Friday the 13th."",You never, ever feel like you're,

,
,in a slasher movie.,It's more fun, it's more open ended,,it's more infinite.,It wasn't superficial.,That's one of the things that makes honor films great.,""Nightmare on Elm Street"" series,,particularly, speaks to these adolescent fears,of not having control.,You can only trust kids of your own age,to even believe in Freddy Krueger.,And all the adults are telling you,,""Get some sleep."" ""Get to sleep."",""Get some rest."",And you know that's the worst,possible thing you can do.,You can look at classic movie monsters -,Frankenstein's monster, the Mummy, Dracula --,and Freddy just fits right in there with them.,""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" not only speaks,the language of cinema, but it speaks,this universal story of the bad dream,,the nightmare and the boogeyman.,In the early 1980s, Wes Craven --,best known for such brutal films as,""Last House On The Left"" and ""The Hills Have Eyes"",would find the inspiration for his,most innovative project in the pages of real life.,The beginning of ""Nightmare on Elm Street"",really came to me with a series of articles,in the L.A. Times about a young men who were,dying in the middle of nightmares.,They were specifically from the Asian Rim,and in this particular case,a young man had a severe nightmare,and told his parents,,""I can't go back to sleep, I'm gonna die,,I just know it."",And the father was a physician and said,,""Let me give you some sleeping pills."",The kid didn't sleep the first night,,then the second night he didn't sleep again.,And then it became clear that he was,trying to stay awake despite everything.,Then finally the kid fell asleep and,they took him upstairs and put him to bed thinking,,""Thank God that little crisis is over."",And in the middle of the night they heard,screams and ran into the room and he was thrashing,on the bed horribly.,Literally, before they got to him he fell still,and he was dead.,In the aftermath, the parents found,all the sleeping pills. He had not taken them,,he had hidden them in the bed.,And they also found a Mr. Coffee machine in his closet,with the hidden extension cord that went to the nearest plug,which, to me, was just so out of a movie.,What if there was somebody in his dream that was,,who killed him? What killed him? What if it's a guy?,My ovim Bible training of the sins of the parents,being visited on the children. That's perfect as,something the parents did to him and just kind of,pieced it together from there.,The reason Elm Street was used is that,I wanted to have an idea,of a place that was just pure Americana.,The school I taught at before l jumped ship,out of academic teaching,was Clarkson College of Technology in Potsdam, New York,and the main street of Potsdam is Elm Street.,And then, of course, Elm Street was the street that,Kennedy was shot on.,I remember showing it to Sean Cunningham,,who did ""Friday the 13th."",He was my first producer,and he said, ""I hate to say it, but,nobody's going to be afraid of this,'cause it's a dream, they'll know,it's a dream so they won't be afraid."",And it went around Hollywood for three years.,The one guy who thought that the script was interesting,was Bob Shaye.,Freddy came along after 10 or 15 years and we had had,some successes before ""Nightmare on Elm Street."",We had made 3 or 4 films before that, small films, all of which,we were able to sell and make our money back,,but none of which did particularly well.,I always did think that producers had something to offer besides,raising money. And I didn't get into this business because,I wanted to make a lot of money, I got into the business,because I wanted to entertain people.,When he started the company, which was 1968,,originally it was not a production company, it was,a distribution company.,New Line Cinema at that time was a small, tiny, tiny company,,I think a few people out of a storefront in the Lower East Side.,Bob was a copyright lawyer and the way Bob,started New Line was that he discovered that the copyright on,""Reefer Madness"" had expired and he picked it up.,When I came to him he had just gotten,""Pink Flamingos"" and it proved to be a big hit.,I think he would carry it around in the trunk of his car,and show it at midnight shows.,They would distribute them in 16 mm to army bases,and prisons and colleges. Those were their three venues.,That was the very, very, very beginning of New Line,as a distribution company.,There was a lot of blood, sweat and toil that went into,the whole process over 40 years.,To everyone's credit that worked there,they worked as hard as they could for something,they loved because it certainly wasn't for money.,It was rough, it was rough.,There were times we couldn't cash our paychecks.,We'd go down to the bank and they'd go,,""You can't do this,"" you know.,One of the guys said, ""You know, we know the youth market,so well that if we could come up with a low budget horror film,,we could really make money."",""Nightmare on Elm Street"" came to Bob Shaye,,he read it and liked it very much.,He immediately knew there was a premise there,that was strong and original.,And I thought it was incredibly inspired because it had this,great marketing hook that was a familiarity,to the entire world,,because we?ve all had nightmares. Everybody sleeps.,Bob is many different things, but he has,an extraordinary intelligence and he was,able to see how that could grab an audience.,We worked with Wes for six months, maybe even a year,,on the story - again -- with very little money.,""Nightmare"" had a killer story. it's one of the two scripts,I've ever picked up and read straight through.,It tried to be something as deep as it could be, you know,,to get right into your soul. What's the source of fear?,It scared me so much, I actually didn't sleep,the night after I read it.,I don't think there's any film I've ever worked on,since then that was effective like that in terms of,just being sheer, plain-ahead terrifying.,Now one step closer to making ""Elm Street"" a reality,,the time had come to find the cast of characters:,sympathetic victims, a resourceful heroine and,the man who would terrorize their dreams.,We had a brilliant young casting woman,,Annette Benson, and she found everyone.,I wanted very much to do young heroines,who didn't trip and fall down, who could fight if they had to.,""Moving angle favoring Nancy.,She's a pretty gin in a letter sweater,with an easy, athletic stride and the look,of a natural leader."",I really feel that she's a totally different,kind of heroine and,I don't think she is interchangeable like a lot,of the girls in slasher movies.,'Heather was interesting to me because',she embodied sort of what I was looking for,,which was a legitimate girl next door.,A survivor girl, one of the leading, classic ingredients,of contemporary horror.,Heather probably being the leading example.,I never felt like, ""Oh gosh, I really need to take,a lot of time,and develop a character.,I really felt like I was going to bring myself to the set,and be as close to me as I could.,I think Freddy considered her a worthy adversary,,but she also has to be the one to go.,She's like his penultimate, if not ultimate, challenge.,As hard as Nancy tries, the only life,she can really save is her own.,And I think that that's actually kind of a very,tragic part of Nancy's character,is that as hard as she tries, she isn't that successful.,""Tina Gray, a strong girl of fifteen in a thin night shift,,moves toward us,down a dark corridor."",I did find the character Tina when I read it,,there was something intrinsically sad about her because,she as sort of a victim,of this broken home and,she's left to really raise herself.,Tina's experience was, ""I want to feel good,and sort of escape,this life that I have,"" but I don't think Tina's character was,much of a survivor.,""''Tina turns to Nancy, but before either can say more,,Rod Lane, a lean, Richard Gere sort in black leather interrupts.,I was pretending to be Italian.,My agent at the time gave me a name,called Nick Carri.,It was taboo. No Latin actor was going to make it.,""Hey, up yours with a twirling mower."",Just, there was a lot of me in it, a lot of me:,cocky, big ego, womanizer.,We weren't really typecast, but our essence of,who we are really was displayed in those characters,and I think that's why all of us were very successful,in portraying that group of teenagers.,'(spooky sound)',The character of Glen was kind of the romantic,lead in a sense. He was the heroine's boyfriend.,We were looking at all the standard Hollywood guys,,but I didn't see anybody that seemed to be,that really charismatic.,Charlie Sheen wanted the role but he wanted $3000 bucks,a week and we didn't have it.,Johnny hadn't done any acting, I don't think.,He was in a band.,I remember Wes saying that it was between,Johnny and one other guy.,My daughter said, ""Dad, Johnny Depp."" I said, ""Really?,But he looks kind of sickly and pale."",She says, ""He's beautiful."",(laughing) And that was it.,The role of Johnny's was supposed to be a jock,,some white dude, big muscular guy.,Johnny comes in with a little baby voice, really sensitive.,(laughing) ""Did you see his face?"",(mocking) ""Did you see his face?"",But he really went for the straight-laced.,He did everything he could do to be that wholesome guy.,I thought he was really successful in it.,Johnny was so terrified when he was first performing.,He would always be in sort of a cold,,clammy sweat and his hands would be trembling.,He was really pushing himself, you know,,into an area that was totally different and,I don't think, something that he felt prepared for at all.,He had an energy level that,just a lot of actors don't have and I think,that's why he's become such a superstar.,He's always been very sweet about,acknowledging that I gave him a start,and I think on ""Actor's Studio"" I've heard that he,has a nice comment about,""Nightmare on Elm Street."",What was your role in ""Nightmare on Elm Street?"",(laughing) I played Glen.,And what happened to Glen?,I get sucked into bed. (audience laughter),Not a bad gig, you know.,It's interesting the people you get to work with,on lower budget films,because a lot of them have quite distinguished careers,and then their careers have maybe gone down a little bit,and they don't get that much work.,So, you can get somebody that's affordable and,at the same time has fantastic experience and chops.,Whether it's Lieutenant Fuller,in ""Black Christmas"",to Lieutenant Thompson,,I guess I made a bridge between the two in some way.,He's worked with everybody,I mean, John Saxon is the man.,You know, you realize,this guy's a legend and he can act and he's awesome.,It's funny, he arrived at the first makeup,session with two little boxes,and he opened them up and there were hairpieces.,I don't think he'll mind me telling this story.,He said, ""Would you like this one, it's a little bit more full,,or this one, I look a little bit more aged."",I think it's kind of rare in horror movies that the heroine has,so many different,relationships going through the plotlines.,We all clicked and that's part of his genius is picking the right,people that had chemistry, that he clearly saw had chemistry.,We would have serious discussions with Wes about,,""Look, we don't want this to be another ""Friday the 13th"",where it's just we're camping and,then a knife goes through the bed,and it's, ""uhhh uhhh."" (knife sound),Let's really make it psychologically damaging and real,and that's what the movie ultimately became.,Freddy's origins, they're sort of multi-various and they all,come together with this character. One was, there was this kid,named Freddy in elementary school,(laughing) and he would beat me up with some regularity.,So the name Fred/Freddy to me was like one of those,names that just brings up all these bad memories.,And then there was this incident of myself as a child,lying in bed at night and I heard this mumbling,and couldn't figure out what the hell it was, you know.,So I crept to the window and there was,this man who, if you would say,,""Oh, put Freddy down the street,"",that's what he would look like, you know.,Somehow he sensed that somebody was watching,and he looked right up into my eyes,and l jumped back in the room and sat on the,edge of the bed waiting for him to go away,and I went back and he was still there and he just,went and then he started walking.,The thing that struck me most about that particular man,was that he had a lot of malice in his face and,he also had this sort of sick sense of humor,about how delightful it was to terrify a child.,The way most villains are cast in these kinds of movies,are usually stuntmen.,Wes' idea was to get a real actor in the role,to add some personality and some elan to it.,I was casting for an old man,because that's how Freddy was written.,When I was reading older men, there was a softness to them,,there was something about having seen,,I think, so much of life, there was a tenderness,to them (laughing) as far as they couldn't really be evil.,David Warner was origin ally cast as Freddy,and I was excited because I saw ""Afier Time."",I loved him as the villain and I was kind of excited about,working with him and then,at the last minute he said he had a prior commitment,that he couldn?t commit to their timeframe and all that,,and that's when Robert came in.,I was really sort of self-preoccupied with my first,boom of success as a result of,the miniseries,My agent had suggested this film called,""A Nightmare on Elm Street"",with this guy Wes Craven, and I went on this interview,expecting to meet the prince of darkness and there was,erudite, tall, preppy, Ralph Lauren-attired Wes Craven there.,He looked kind of semi-geeky,and he was much younger than I was looking for.,I saw him coming and it was like,""They want him to play Freddy?"",He just didn't look it, he was kind of happy-go-lucky.,Wes is very kind to me,and says that he saw something in me.,And perhaps he did. I hope that's the truth.,He just relished being evil,and it brought out that wonderful thing about Freddy,of, it's the guy on the sidewalk frightening the kid,,but he was also was able to do it in almost a funny way.,Robert created the character, he created a real, real character.,So everyone was thrilled because Robert brought,much more to the table than a guy in a hockey mask.,The rest was makeup and once the makeup was on,you didn't know how old he was anyway.,(laughing) It was like, ""Duh, what was I thinking?"",David Miller,was of ""Thriller"" with John Landis,,so I knew I was in good hands because that,was the state-of-the-an phenomenon.,The final design for Freddy was based on pepperoni pizza.,I was at a restaurant one night and I was having pizza,and I was just kind of deep in thought.,I started playing around with the cheese,,putting it around the pepperoni and I actually,made Freddy's face on the pizza.,David just whipped open this medical textbook for me,the first day I sat down,and he said, ""This is what we're going to do to you."",And it was real burn victims.,It's hard to imagine that Robert alone could have,the patience for someone,touching his face like that all the time.,Always touching, always prodding.,A lot of what I discovered that I used for the,entire experience of playing Freddy,was those first few makeup applications,in David Millers garage somewhere,,teasing him or telling him to get a brush out of my eye.,(menacing) ""David!"",I found a little bit of Freddy in there.,When Robert was done with the day,,as soon as they yelled ""Cut!"",he would start ripping it to pieces and throw them behind him,as he would walk to the makeup room for me to take,the makeup off, and by the time,he would get there, half his makeup was off already,,and there would be people behind him,with plastic bags picking up the pieces,,(laughing) and they'd come to me later on and say,,(laughing) ""What pan do I have?"",He came up with a lot more physicality, you know,,the way he was moving the claws and everything,that were very original and distinctive.,I really made conscious choices,I recognized how great the silhouette was,and how great the shadow was.,And so I really physicalized him a lot.,I used Klaus Kinski but I also used a little bit,of Jimmy Cagney in there,,that little spread-legged, strong gangster stance that,Cagney uses, was something I kind of had,going on in the back of my head, too.,A lot of the monsters of past were misunderstood,,they were kind of innocent.,But Freddy Krueger is not innocent.,The real fact of Freddy that nobody really talks about,,I think it was that Freddy molested the kids,,but they really kind of...,side-stepped that.,While we were filming the original film,,there was this,huge national news story.,The McMartin trial was going on endlessly. A school for children,where the children had accused teachers of molesting them,,on a very systematic way.,We had to salt-pedal the sexuality a little bit,,but that was probably even better,because it becomes subtext.,That's a character entire modus operandi is about,the fact that he knows the fear he's causing you, he knows,that he's screwing with you before the kill.,He could kill you right away, that's not the point.,The fun is in prolonging it. It's the foreplay, in Freddy's case.,Freddy's in those teenage girls' bedrooms,,he's in their bed with them,,he's in their dreams with them, and that's about,as much as you could ever hope to violate anyone.,That's more of a violation than rape and so I think that, in and of,itself, is one of the great hooks to ""A Nightmare on Elm Street."",You know, in my mind, the killer of children,is about the most despicable,thing you can think and the most,,the deepest and most profound betrayal,of the innocence of a child.,But at the same time, there was something deeper in the original,about morality play with Freddy being a child molester,and the whole town having their dirty secret,that they had committed murder,,group murder, themselves.,And it also made the moral issue of if it's a really,despicable human being, do you have the right,to take the law into your hands.,It is this story that makes you search your own soul about,vigilante justice and decent people doing bad things,in the name of what they consider justice.,Two wrongs don't make a right and,,certainly, being burned alive is not,'due process..,Oh, I do think that vigilante justice is an answer,to someone like Freddy Krueger.,I would never want that kind of crime on my hands, but,it happens, it happens all the time.,Freddy is a warning. He is talked about and,he's whispered about.,The spectre has infiltrated their imaginations.,I love the idea that behind one of those garage doors,,in a white trash neighborhood, Fred Krueger was there,with his vise making that thing...,and dreaming and fantasizing about,what he was going to do and,when he put it on it emboldened him.,There was a lot of killers with masks and with,some sort of an edged weapon.,Wes was sort of stuck on what the weapon was going to be.,What's the earliest weapon that mankind,might have been afraid of?,And it would be, well, the weapon of an animal.,The cave bear, you know, something that could,reach around the comer,with these big giant claws.,And he described it as something like ""long fingernails,"",so I went off and did some sketches,and actually built the test fingers,,how the glove might look and function.,Reading that script and knowing that I had to build that glove,,I felt I was just building this character,that was part of the film.,The claw extends Freddy,,it extends his evil, it extends his anger.,Freddy made it in the basement,,so the glove had to actually be kind of crude.,It almost looks like a junior high,school shop project from hell.,I think in those boiler room scenes he's the scariest,,'cause he was always scratching those nails against the pipes.,He would really do that and annoy everybody.,'(nails scratching)',Aaahhh!,How the glove affected me was,,it's heavy, and when I put it on,one shoulder dropped a bit and it affected my movement,and it affected my posture, and I immediately thought,,it's like a holster, it's like a gunslinger's thing.,So that posture became signature,for Freddy Krueger.,When I first meet Freddy head-on in the alley,we shot that in the middle of the night in Venice, California,it was freezing.,Freddy was coming down the alleyway,and his arms were extending.,That was all simple marionetting,,where you've got guys on the garage roofs,with long versions of fishing poles,,with wire holding up the Freddy arms.,It looked ridiculous.,Jacques hated this thing and with good reason.,I was a little concerned that it was going to look too fake,,too cheesy, not scary enough.,I was surprised...,at how well it came out in terms of people accepting it.,The death of Tina,is pretty brutal stuff, I mean, it really holds up.,It appeared to be a little bit of a red herring because,you almost kind of think...,Tina's going to be the heroine at the beginning, in a way.,That's the real nod to Hitchcock.,Since Wes wanted something really big and fantastic,and out there for the first death, Tina's death,,I suggested that we do a rotating room.,They took it from Fred Astaire,dancing on the walls and the roof.,And that situation was quite a hairy situation,,that scene where she's dragged up the wall,,there were no wires or anything dragging her,,we were rotating the entire set.,Everything in the room was naked down,',the cameraman was in like an,airplane seat attached to the wall.,It would take a couple of people,to just turn that room,and actually make it move without,using any mechanical means.,As you get turned upside down,,you're still operating the camera,,but you're brain is upside down.,I was either crawling or being dragged,,however I was always on the ﬂoor.,Boy, did she ever do that,that moment when she's killed,she just nailed it.,The blood and her being dragged,up the walls and down walls,,a brutal sequence.,It was extremely disorienting. I know at the end of the take,,she stood up and she said, ""I can't move."",I had the sensation I was falling,and I completely ﬂipped out. It was like,,""Stop, I have to get out! I have to get out!"",And then here comes Wes, all calm,,sticking his up through the window.,He's like, ""Check this out, I'm standing on the ground,,you're laying here, we're looking at each other, you're not,falling."" (laughing) It's like, ""onnnn!"",As I looked around thinking I was going to reassure her,,I started feeling nauseated.,It was a very, very strange set.,I remember that when the stuntwoman slammed,onto the bed, blood slapped me on the face.,There was this beautiful, sort of slow-motion,(blood splashing sound),because we had the bed just loaded with blood.,And the censors, the censors,went after that whole scene.,As soon as she hit the bed,,we were not allowed to show any splash whatsoever.,There was nothing fake in the first one. We were all there,in the same room, we were all acting together.,The reality of it being really there with the actor,makes such a difference in their performance.,The fact that we do the stuff live,and that we do it on camera and we get it in one take,or two takes, or whatever,,is pan of the romance of the genre.,In the high school scene Where I'm sitting in the class,,we had a lot of extras there.,It's the first time that Heather,is really confronted with the dream.,Lin Sh aye is the sister of the producer, so she had,this really important part as the teacher.,I gotta say, I was somewhat shocked how much impact,the English teacher,had on people. That they remembered her and,,""I have a teacherjust like that."",And then the strange reading of ""Hamlet,"",which is so Wes, you know,,to have some classic Shakespeare reference on top of that.,I read it straight, and then Wes came up and asked me if I'd,repeat it again in a stage whisper.,(whispering) ""Bad dreams."",When ""Cut!"" was called, people started kind of laughing,and then I received a standing ovation.,Wes and I, we always had a joke.,I'm like, ""Try to explain this to me, Wes,"",and he's like, ""I can't explain it, it's just a dream."",And I'm like, ""Okay, thank you."" (laughing),The image of the body bag,just in the hallway, scared me so much.,First of all, your psyche does not want,to be in a bodybag when you're alive.,Your body and your brain says, ""Don't let them zip this up,"",because there's not a zipper on the in side,so you're really at the mercy of the people,taking care of you.,My heart was going out to Amanda because she,had to do the grossest things.,There were eels and centipedes and,it was very disturbing and I was upset. Both Heather and I,were very upset while we were filming those scenes.,And she's always such a trouper,and they always kind of push the envelope,to see how much she would do.,And then, finally, she would say,,""Okay, three centipedes... that's enough,The hall pass line is, of course,,became a favorite of people's, actually.,""Where's your pass?"",""Screw your pass!"",With Robert's voice coming out of my mouth, I guess kids,didn't expect it and it just really grossed them out.,""No running in the hallway."",It's an archetype that Wes just tapped into,,even the clothes that he wears, the stripes.,And the red and the green together,actually were from an article on how,the eye and the retina deal with color and those two colors,were very diff cult for the eye to see side by side. So I said,, ""Great, that will be the stripes of the sweater."" (laughing),So I, literally, made him into a sort of painful optical effect.,There was a lot of pressure on the original film, I think,,because...,there was no money.,There were tensions between Bob and Wes,,and it was obvious to everybody.,And I knew that Bob had mortgaged his company,and his life and his house and everything,to create this film. And I knew that Wes had signed away,the rights to the characters and all this to create this film.,Wes and I had a little bit of a disagreement,about who was doing what,,and he wanted me to stick in my role as a producer.,You've got two strong personalities,,both ofvimich shared a vision of the end,but they might not have shared every day,the vision of how to get there.,One of the big fights I remember between Bob and Wes,was over the sticky stairs.,'Bob was obsessed with this image and Wes',wasn't particulany interested in it.,The Bob Shaye imprint in large measure came,from some of my own nightmares,that's why I was just,offering them up to Wes. (laughing),I don't know if it was in the script, but they decided to have,the carpet just cut,and then they poured in a bunch of oatmeal mixed with,mushroom soup or something like that.,'K was Bisquick',If you mix Bisquick up too thick and you let it sit,for about an hour, it becomes the most sticky, gooey,,tenacious stuff on the planet.,Wes fin ally deigned to let me say ""Action!"" at least.,(laughing) There wasn't very much directing to go on.,Letting him ""direct,"" call ""Action!"" and ""Cut!"" on that,,was kind of a way of saying, ""Come on, we're friends,"",and you know, ""We're in this together."",You know, ultimately, I think Bob and I both respected,each other all the way through and we both knew,we had everything to win or lose with the film.,We had 80 effects, shots,OI' SEQUEHCES,in a 90-minute film,that we were shooting in 26 days.,Poor Heather's been haunted by,phallic moments, you know. (laughing),The first one with Freddy coming out of the bathtub,between her legs.,They built a bathtub on our soundstage that,had no bottom and then it had, instead, a tank.,So I had the distinct pleasure of having,Heather Langenkamp sitting on my knees,with her feet resting on my shoulders for an entire day.,And he's the one who has the hand,that comes up with the Freddy glove on it.,Rod's death scene in the jail,was technically complicated.,When they try to hang me, they hang me,on fishwire, but the fishwire wasn't,strong enough, so the first time I crashed and burned, I fell.,There's one shot in there where it's shot in reverse,where the thing actually snakes around his neck.,It was the old days, it was the way to do it, you know.,Kind of archaic, but it works.,""I couldn't even see the fucker."",Well the jail scene, I was really depressed.,I'm not going to say the drug I was doing,,but I was ripped.,I was passed out,and Wes, I think, Wes was like,,""Are you ready for this shoot?"",I'm crying, not because of the scene,,I'm crying because my life is shitty at the time.,I really regret that I brought a substance,and changed my acting,,but I'm clean after 25 years. I'm sober.,What I like so much about the story,,and about Renee Blakley and John Saxon's,portrayal, is that you really don't understand at the beginning,why they have this kind of conspiratorial relationship.,I guess I played the role,,or it was intended to be,,someone who is harsh and a little tough.,My relationship with my father is,the most distant and the most diff cult.,He's not willing to go there and admit that Nancy's,having these real dreams.,Heather was saying things about,""Fred Krueger"",and I'd say, ""Stop that kind of stuff, this is nonsense.,Don't talk to me about that."",Ronee Blakley's character was interesting, you know.,She's this alcoholic mother and it was important to me,that there was this drifi from a woman who was saying,""You're crazy,"" to her child.,And she actually has the weight of the world,on her shoulders because of her crime,in creating Freddy Krueger.,And once she has disclosed that she and her cohorts,of the other parents have essentially caused,the deaths of their own children,,starts drinking heavily,to the point where when Nancy is about to face,her worst test, her mother isn't there and has to be,kind of put to bed like a little child.,She becomes such an important yin to my yang.,I don't think the movie would have been as good without,her being a little bit more intense than I think,our average parent character is these days.,Nancy comes home and there's bars on all the windows.,And then, later, when she needs to get out,of the house, she can't because,she's locked from the inside.,And goes to her mother and the mother says,,""Locked, locked, locked."" (laughing),The battle's about to be,enjoined with Freddy and it's going,to take place in the house.,And what her mom has done,by putting bars on is ensured that,there will be no escape.,I'm trying to talk to Glen and trying to wam him that,,you know, he's about to get killed by Freddy,if he falls asleep,and I look dovm and it's Freddy's,mouth and tongue and he says,,""I'm your boyfriend now, Nancy."",That shocked people so much.,It was one of the most,startling moments of the first film,and the special effects cost $5.,Heather unwanted to, eventually,,take that thing home,and we thought it was a little strange.,Then the rotating room ended up getting used again,for Johnny Depp's death,,but that wasn't originally planned that way.,Johnny Depp went through a mattress.,(laughing) He's got his headphones on,,and all of a sudden,The blood spilling out of the bed,,that was a one take deal.,Big pressure there.,Wes, who is now strapped to one of the camera chairs,,would say, ""Go."",We tumed the room upside down, the bed was now,at the top.,When they started dumping the red water, the blood,,through the thing, as soon as it hit the ceiling,and hit the light,it immediately electrified the water,,so the guy pouring the water got electrocuted.,(laughing) Oops.,You got hundreds of gallons of water,now sloshing on the ﬂoor.,Which threw the weight off entirely,,and the WhOIE thing suddenlyjust shifted.,And the room started going like this.,That room started to turn.,And the room got out of control from the operators.,And there was no way we were stopping it.,It rolled all the way over,because the weight of the blood,went to the wrong side of the ceiling.,And we were up there,jumping out of the way of,cables and ropes that were ripping out.,Water went into all the lights and there were these huge,ﬂashes in the dark, and we were spinning in the dark,(laughing) with sparks going off.,And the wall had a window in it.,And, of course, the blood all poured out the window on us,,so the crew that was turning the room is,standing there completely covered in blood.,So, the room stopped upside dovm and,we were hanging upside dovm for at least 20 minutes.,Caused Jacques to make noises that no man should,ever have to make unless he's actually dying.,Itwas pretty funny, though.,(laughing),No one was hurt, we got the shot.,It just came out so totally cool. So, pan of the reason,that that effect looks like that,is because of this fortuitous mistake.,I think there was a little bit more to John ny Depp's,bloody room scene.,I guess his head was going to come out of the bed,once he gets sucked down in there,and it spits him back out.,Actually, I remember it was pretty scary.,I don't know why it was cut.,At a certain point, you felt like,,""Well, the scene's over."",We did use the room again,in ""Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo."",""Booby Traps and Improvised Anti-Personnel Devices?"",I had read this Army manual called ""Improvised Weapons"",and it was all about how to make booby traps.,Every one of those little gags and all those things were,things that came out of either somebody's,imagination,or we got from one of the books on doing booby traps.,(laughing) There were several films that I did that had booby,traps.,I just thought they were fun.,After a while I just said, (laughing) ""You can't have,any more booby traps, Craven."",The whole sequence of Freddy getting lit up in the cellar-,turning, running up the stairs,,falling down, rolling back dovm the stairs -,is all one shot.,That was one take.,And I wouldn't have believed that anybody,could burn for that long and then get up and,start back up the stairs again.,We were just standing there in awe.,The scene where my mom gets pulled dowrn,into the bed in the fiery blaze of light,,of all the scenes in the movie, it's the most fantastic.,You have Freddy, you have my mother,,you have my dad, you have me,,and nothing really makes sense at this point.,""I take back every bit of energy I gave you."",What the ending of the original ""Nightmare on Elm Street"",means, symbolically with Nancy turning her back on Freddy, is,""I won't participate in fear."",The fear that Freddy engenders.,It's a very simple solution to all this mayhem.,Nancy realizes that that's how you stop it,is not to surrender to it. So that's actually,,I think, a very satisfying ending.,It's a confusing scene because with the ending that we,now have, it doesn't quite make sense. If I turn my back and,and that was supposed to be a successful resolution, then,the fact that Freddy comes back means I failed.,We were uncertain about the ending.,We didn't really feel like we had it right.,Wes wanted the ending to be that Heather woke up in the,morning and the sun was shining and she walked away.,He wanted to have a big hook to the picture,so that he could have a sequel.,And I thought he was crazy.,There will never be a sequel. Boy, was I stupid.,I've been accused of fighting for a,movie that could have sequels,but that wasn't really the case.,I just felt that,the ending to the movie didn't send the audience out,with any great excitement.,He and I had lots of arguments.,I even think my father got involved.,(laughing) They were asking his opinion.,I said, ""Okay, fine I'll put them in a car,and we'll have the car have Freddy's stripes.,They asked us to do three or four different versions,of different things happening surrounding the car.,There always was this sense,that Freddy was the car.,We ended up shooting two or three different endings.,There was one Wnere I drive the car.,There was one where Johnny drives the car.,We shot it without the top coming up,,we shot it with the top coming up.,The irony is that we used all of the endings, just about.,But it was always Wes' idea to pan,to the little ginsjumping rope,,which is such an evocative ending.,That's the real ending and it's brilliant.,But he did get his hook.,We kind of compromised on the hook.,(screaming),The effect with Ronee works great on film,,but When we shot it, it was really silly shit. (laughing),It was just so comical looking.,I couldn't figure out how they did it,,so I thought it was totally cool.,We had an articulated dummy that we used,for several different things in the film,,and so we just dressed it up as Renee.,It had to be all very squishy 'cause he wanted it,to go through a window.,And the dummy went (swooshing),and was sucked through the window. (laughing),it worked well enough, there's no question about that, but,,you know, when you see it today it's a little silly. But, so what?,I felt actually very bad about doing that,,but I also felt very much that Bob was the only person,that was able to get this picture going and championed it,,so I gave him his hook.,I look at the entire film ""Nightmare on Elm Street"",as a precognitive nightmare of Nancy.,Everything in it will happen, but it hasn't really happened,,she's just dreamt that it's going to happen and she's trying to,wam everybody.,And then it begins,at the very ending there.,(singing) ""...three, four, better lock your door..."",Before I came on ""Nightmare on Elm Street"",the little jump rope nursery rhyme thing had been worked out.,(Singing) ""One, two, Freddy's coming for you..."",(humming),which was set to this little nursery rhyme that I had written,,but I had no idea of how that could be set to music.,And I think it was Heather's boyfriend,who came up with that little rhyme.,My boyfriend was a musician. We were just sitting,around the piano one time and he sat down,and he just did this little minor key thing.,And I kept that element and kind of worked it into the score,in a few places because it seemed to be important,,and I'm sewing the film.,If you can get just the right musical phrase and then play it,a million different ways, and backwards and upside dovm and,different instrumentation, it unifies the entire film.,And then I thought, ""Let's have a theme.,Let's get a melody involved here."",(Playing piano),So, the melody is playing with your sense of order,(playing piano), maybe we go to there (playing piano),,and another note that doesn't belong (playing piano).,That theme really created the ﬂavor for the film.,When ""ANightmare on Elm Street"" was,rejected by every major Hollywood studio,,Robert Shaye and New Line Cinema took the,ultimate gamble by releasing the film on their OWH.,And on November 9, 1984, all eyes watched,to see if that bet would pay off.,The film could have, literally, destroyed the company,,and, so, there was a lot of tension around,that during the release of the film.,When the film open ed,to see this huge line around the block on Broadway,of people waiting to get into the theater,,then I knew that the fuse had been lit.,I took my son, who was 12. We sat and watched it.,My son nudged me and said, ""Pop, this is really good."",And I said, ""Yeah, I think it is, it really is."",Completely scared me. I think I was enough removed,from it that I got lost in the story.,Even though I worked on the film,,there were parts that scared me.,It got into your bones on some level.,That's why Wes is so good at this. He really loves to,explore the psychology of people's minds,and understands that fear is one of the,most important emotions that people have.,The fact that ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" was,a critical success and a financial success,helped me immensely.,When I started on the film I was penniless.,It was the first film that made that amount of money for us.,I mean it wasnt like hundreds of millions of dollars,,but it was a few million anyhow.,It put New Line Cinema on the map.,To think that it was such a big financial issue that a company's,life depended on less than $2 million -- that's pretty amazing.,I think ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" put me into the big time,,so to speak. I mean, it certainly gave me recognition.,Wes became ""Horror Meister"" Wes Craven and,I became ""Horror Star,"",""Slasher Star“ Robert Englund.,It had already achieved a cult status,very quickly, and very shortly,after that it began to snowball.,""1"" was the real seminal movie and it still has,some really genius scenes in it.,And I think I did some things that were really innovative,and have had the chance to work with some enormously,talented and wonderfully spirited people.,And it doesn't get much better than that in the business.,Aiter their first taste of mainstream success, New Line Cinema,immediately realized it was time to think about Freddy's future,and the ""Nightmare"" they now owned.,I don't think that we were thinking about a sequel. Who,knew that it would even be this successful? We didn't know.,After the film opened so big on the weekend,the head of distribution went right in to Bob Shaye,and said, ""We need a sequel."",We weren't calculatedly trying to capitalize on the thing,,we just, this was the only project we had that had sequel,potential.,Bob Sh aye had basically leveraged his ass off on the first one.,He'd sold all the rights off to get the movie made.,The other entity, the other financial entity, I think,,just kind of crucified him and took a lot ofvmat he had.,So that when ""Nightmare on Elm Street"",the original made a healthy profit,it wasn't really a profit that went into Bob's pockets,,nor did it really help his studio.,What Bob came away with was a copyright on something,that could be very, very valuable.,And New Line was always stumbling ﬂ'om one,distribution movie to another distribution movie,,and, so, this was a chance to be able,to create a little bit of cash ﬂow.,The signal definitely was there that,,""I own this and I'm gonna do with it what I want."",Wes didn't want this movie to be a franchise.,I didn't want to keep going on something that,was owned by somebody else.,I don't think that there was a real conversation about,Wes doing ""Nightmare 2"",because he and Bob had such a stressed relationship.,It was a longtime before, I think, they spoke to each other.,The bone of contention really was a profit participation and,not so much about having the courtesy to offer him,to direct the next movie.,So, we ended up going to a young man, David Chaskin,,who worked in our 16mm distribution department,,(laughing) but he had written a script that we'd,option ed because we liked it.,I just thought that it would be fun for,Freddy to have a human avatar,that's actually doing stuff in the real world.,That was where I took ofifrom:,possession.,I thought the script was quite inferior and I had a lot of notes.,And they said, ""We just want to shoot this,"" so off they went.,A good friend of mine, Jack Sh older, agreed to direct the film.,Jack Sholder had been making trailers for us,and he was very talented.,One of our first films that we ever produced,he directed, called ""Alone in the Dark."",Jack was pretty good technically.,He had come out of editing, so he knew how to tell stories.,I was never a huge fan of the original.,I mean, I understood why it was good,and I understood why it was successful,,but I felt no compunction to follow the template of the first film.,I wasn't asked to do ""Nightmare 2."" I think that the script was,probably developed quickly aﬂer ""Nightmare 1."",To my knowledge, nobody ever talked about bringing,Heather Ian genkamp back,to do ""Nightmare 2"" simply because I think they had,determined, at that point, to do a completely different story.,And, you know, that house was so iconic,,that it made a lot of sense to focus on the house,and the next inhabitants of that house.,There was a problem with Robert,because Robert's agent started getting wise.,I was already feeling ownership,of Freddy by then.,They were asking all kinds of money that we didn't have and,we were certainly in a dither about what to do.,And Bob Shaye said, ""Why do we need to have Robert,Englund? Because it's just a guy in a rubber mask."",They didn't even know that Freddy was the franchise.,We started ""Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2"",with an extra in a rubber suit and mask.,And he was just atrocious. He would walk like a,dime store monster. He would sort of hunker around.,Moving around like Frankenstein,,going like this.,He was just terrible, terrible.,Jack said to Bob, ""You're a fool if you use,anybody else besides Robert."",So, by him saying that, I think eany on,,to Bob Shaye,I think that kind of helped me.,It really proved to everyone that it's not just,a guy in a rubber mask.,Casting ""Nightmare 2"" was,a fascinating experience.,We really were looking for the best actors, period.,""Closer angle - the boy, about 17, four-eyes, bad skin,,lousy posture and an obvious inferiority complex."",I was cast as Jesse in the lead role in,""Nightmare on Elm Street Pan 2"",after auditioning for the first,""Nightmare on Elm Street"" forWes Craven.,I knew who Mark Patton was from,""Come Back to the Five & Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean."",I'd seen that and I just thought he was wonderful in that.,He had a real kind of vulnerability about him that I liked.,Brad Pitt and Christian Slater also came in to read for the role,and I had no idea who they were.,How many famous people I actually rejected,in favor of Mark Patton.,""Ronny Grady, a tou gh-looking wise-ass type,,steps up to the plate."",',The last day of filming ""Weird Science"",was the day I had an audition for ""Nightmare 2."",Robert Dovmey Jr. gave me a ride to my audition,and Mark and I went in and we read together,and they hired us on the spot.,Robert Rusler and I were allowed to sit in on,the casting of the girl, for the lead, for Lisa.,""Jesse opens the front door to Lisa Poletti. Real pretty, with,an intelligence and sweetness about her. She is truly lovely."",The bond that Mark and I had,really began from the time we met.,There was just an easy quality in how we related.,I just loved her from the minute I met her. She was adorable.,It was her first, you know, big break.,We auditioned her and we cast her,simply based on her talent.,And the fact that she looked like Meryl Streep.,""Kerry, a dizzy, Bloomingdale's-punk, steps up,alongside Lisa as the latter catches Jesse's stare."",The reason I love this movie is that it changed my life.,I had a ticket to go back to NewYom,,move back to New York and be done with Hollywood and,they cast me in the movie. And it was like the deciding thing,of me staying here, and I never left.,And then it was just off and running, it was ofiand running.,The first big gag was the scene,when the bus is hurtling through the burnt out desert.,Jesse was this nerdy outcast,and Freddy is taking over,and about to take him for this ride.,The whole movie is the ride that Freddy takes him through.,We had this mechanical bus up on a thing,and it would tilt back and forth,and we got into the bus.,And at, one point, there wasn't a whole lot of acting for me,going on 'cause we were getting jostled all over the place,At one point, it was, like, ""Wham!"" and I slam my nose on the fiont of the,bar and the rest of the day I was in such pain I was screaming and crying.,Robert was very into it, which is great. You need that, you know.,It's great to feed off of. For me, I love that.,For the first one, you didn't see anything of Freddy.,I mean, you saw him in the shadows, he barely said a word.,We tried to make Freddy a little more talkative.,Freddy got more vocal, his character,got more dimensionalized.,""We got special work to do here, you and me."",At the time, horror movie villains --,Jason, Michael Myers -- they didn't talk.,Freddy talked.,He had a certain black sense of humor.,David Miller started off doing the special makeup effects for,Freddy Krueger,and did a brilliant job. So brilliant, I guess, that when we came,in to do the sequel, we decided to bring another guy in.,I just didn't have time to do another ""Nightmare on Elm Street."" I,just finished the other one and I thought, ""Okay, time to move on."",We got another guy, Kevin Yagher,,who we'd worked with in the past.,Dave Miller and I just spoke at the very beginning about,basically passing on the torch, passing the baton to me.,There's a big myth that we have a big rivalry going,and all that stuff,,'cause he stole Freddy and all that. It's not like that at all.,They didn't know what they had,in ""Nightmare on Elm Street 1,"" they had no idea what kind,ofhit it was going to be, so they barely took any photographs.,Kevin had a really hard time just trying to figure out what was going on on the face.,It was like, ""What is all this? I can't figure it out."",I wanted to give it bone structure.,I wanted to give it cheekbones and kind of make it,more like a male witch. You know, give it a hook nose.,I had convinced Bob Shaye to change Freddy's eyes from,Robert Englund's normal green eyes to these sort of,demonic, red and yellow/amber-colored eyes.,There was something odd about it and,it fits in fine, it actually worked.,""What that boy needs is a good goddamn kick in the butt."",The parents in a horror movie usually don't get to be,up front and center and doing really cool thin gs.,They're usually in sort of reactive roles.,It's very dangerous being a male actor in motion pictures.,As I discovered, repairing a home,is equally dangerous.,One of my favorite moments in Nightmare's sophisticated,mechanical effects history, was the parakeet on a stick.,There was a scene in mmich the father,was attacked by a bird in the living room.,I think that was a reference to the movie ""The Birds."",The birds are the first ones to react to, like in a mine, they,react to the gas, that was basically the concept. That the bird,was the warning signal of Freddy coming.,So we built this demonic parakeet,and itwas demonic, I'll tell ya.,It was oversized, it had a rod coming out of its butt,and it could ﬂap its wings and move its head.,I think it didn't get used because,it wasn't parakeet-like enough.,The physical effects guy was a guy,named Dick Albain, he was an old-timer.,When I interviewed him I asked him what he felt his,greatest work was and he thought a minute and he said,,""I think the work I did with the Three Stooges',was my greatest work."",So that probably should have given me pause.,He had this big long stick with this invisible fishing,cord tied to this prosthetic bird and,he would wave it back and forth in front of my face.,He wanted it to attack.,The parakeet was not exactly what I had in mind.,It was one of those things that we just did in five minutes.,It just was so obvious that it wasn't going to work.,And sure enough, it cracked right into my eye, scarred it.,I don't know if Clu ever recovered from the parakeet scene.,He's a little tweaked by it still.,It scared the shit out of me. I was just petrified.,It was a kind of a dopey scene.,I mean, a lot of the scenes in the movie were.,Any movie with Clu Gulager and an exploding bird,,gotta be good.,One of the film's many detours saw a role reversal that,introduced audiences to a new kind of horror hero,,bringing Freddy out of the boiler room,,and most memorably, out of the closet.,I think there was a certain amount of seduction,going on between Freddy and Jesse.,There always is a dance with Freddy.,There always is a seduction, there always is a dare.,And if Freddy was in fact what they always say Freddy was --,he was a pedophile, child killer -- sex meant nothing to him.,All he wanted was me.,Because I was the vehicle he was going to move through.,Almost all the horror films of the '80s featured,women as the protagonist,and it's not hard to understand why.,They were easier to portray as victims.,It just made the sexual threat and the chemistry richer.,But I think they had to have made,""Nightmare on Elm Street Pan 2"" to discover that.,Because when you suddenly cast your male lead in the victim,role, and then you have him scream like a gin for 90 minutes,,you're going to have some people going,,""Well, that's not the manliest performance I've ever seen."",(screaming),In fact, I may be the first male scream queen.,I simply did not have the self-awareness to realize,that any of this might be interpreted as gay.,And I actually don't think that, originally,,Jesse was written as a gay character.,I think it's something that happened,along the line by serendipity.,I also had not the slightest idea that,one of my lead actors was gay.,The fact that Mark Patton was an openly gay actor,I don't think had been revealed at that time yet.,We made ""Nightmare 2"" absolutely clueless that it had,any gay overtones whatsoever.,I'm absolutely sure there's not one moment,that I remember that it was discussed.,I never saw it.,I didn't get it.,When I was shooting I had no notion this was happening. Although,,I didn't get a blowjob on the set, if that's what you mean.,But looking back,,it was so gay, it was amazing.,If you're called the ""Homo Nightmare on Elm Street"",on the net by a million pre-pubescent boys,,'men a bunch of grown men had m know what may were doing..,All I can say is we were all incredibly naive or,all incredibly latently gay. I'm not sure which.,But I do think it remains one of the most sort of debated,movies of all time because it's so,,it's not even under the surface, it's so there.,You know, we've always pussyfooted around this.,Look, it was supposed to be subtext, alright, it really was.,David Chaskin, without a doubt, knewvimat he was writing.,You have to remember again, this was the 1980s,,this was post-AIDS.,People were really out a lot then...,maybe not in Kansas, but certainly on both coasts.,And I started thinking about guys being unsure of their sexuality,and I thought, ""Well, that's pretty scary."",If David said that I am astounded,,because I certainly didn't get it either.,There was so much like S & M and this,really precarious relationship,between Mark Patton and I throughout the movie.,It, you know, this is probably the ""Top Gun"",of franchise horror films.,I kind of think there was this subliminal thing that was,going on in Jack's mind,where he didn't really realize it,,but everything he did amplified it.,You have a board game named ""Probe"" on it,,he has a sign on the door that says ""No Chicks Allowed."",The production designer in the film was gay.,And I think it became like an inside joke which,they thought nobody would really pick up on.,But in terms of the kinky gimmick of ""Part 2,"",I think it's really interesting.,Freddy appeals to that,gay part that's like, the questions, he appeals to,the questions that Jesse's asking himself.,Freddy could represent the self-hatred, you know,,in the gay community. He could also represent,just the taunt.,""You son of a bitch!"",I think that Mark gave a really great performance because,there were so many levels of his insecurities.,And I think that's what I was doing in ""Nightmare on Elm Street"",is I was revealing who I really was,,and I think that came clearly through the screen.,The gayest thing in the movie, by the way,,is Bob Shaye himself.,Bob Shaye has always been a slightly fiustrated actor.,He had wanted to play,the father of Robert Rusler.,I said, ""I need a real actor to play that role."",Bob got very offended by that and, at one point,,he even threatened to fire me.,Jack could end up being a jerk from time to time,and that uvas one of his jerkier episodes.,I said, ""Well, let me give you another role."",So I thought, ""Hey, I'll put him in this gay bar."",Jack said, ""Go to the Pleasure Chest,and get yourself an outfit."",So, I went to the Pleasure Chest and I happened,to have my two young daughters with me,,who were like 10 and 12 at the time.,The guywho was the clerk was watching,and my little daughter said, ""Oh, there's a great,...thing to put on your arms with spikes and stuff,"" and,""Here's a great T-shirt for you, Papa,"" and stuff like that.,So the clerk comes over to me and he said, (laughing),""I think these children should wait outside while you,purchase what you're going to be purchasing."" (laughing),Bob Shaye looked darling in his leather costume.,As the bartender. He was so sweet.,And I want you to know that we all believed him.,Hmm.,(sighiﬂg),And then you have Coach Schneider's character.,He, like the character of Jesse, had some secrets.,I don't think Coach Schneiderwas ever a very good guy.,I did direct a lot of the shower scene with Marshall Bell and,,wow, what was I thinking?,The Coach's balls being pan of the attack.,I'm trying to think through whether or not,there was something Freudian about that.,I love that scene in the movie. I mean, I don't care for,Marshall Bell's ass, though. (laughing),I don't think it was my idea to,snap Marshall's bare ass with towels.,It's what I would've liked to have seen happen to,my Phys. Ed. teacher in school.,You get what you give in life and Coach Schneider was,really good at giving and he wasn't really great at receiving.,Read into it what you will,,but I just thought it was a horror scene,,which really makes me feel stupid.,If there was one thing that I could delete from,my filmography and my entire life,,it would be that dance scene in my bedroom.,I actually find that scene a little bit embarrassing.,""Risky Business"" had had this very successful,scene with Tom Cruise.,We were just riffing on that particular,pop culture deal. It was some really,uncool dance moves.,Mark didn't want to do it.,And Mark kept kind of postponing it and finally, when,it came time getting closer to the scene, he said,,""Look, I've got it all worked out,,just roll the cameras and let it go and I'll,give you a whole performance."",And I'm going, ""Oh God, this is not what I had in,mind."" (laughing),I understand the video was played in gay clubs a lot.,It will go along forever and ever and ever,and my butt will bouncing and I'll have that,horrible hair and those hideous glasses.,And, again, it was a choice. It was another one of those choices,that really brought the subtext way up right in yourface.,When the shit hits the fan,,Jesse rejects his girlfriend to go and stay at the house,with the best friend.,""I need you to let me stay here tonight."",""Are you out of your mind?"",I can't believe that this particular line is written this way.,""Something is trying to get inside my body."",""And you want to sleep with me?"",(laughing) Sounds like, ""And you want to sleep with me."",At that point I realized, you know, a lot of people are,going to go down this road with these two boys.,And you get the, one of the strangest,,most symbolic scenes potentially, in horror history,,as Freddy tears his way out ofJesse's body.,I remember the screenplay said distinctly,,""Freddy bursts out of Jesse."",That's all it said. There was no,description of what we're going to do.,Mark Shostrom created those effects,and he did a tremendous job.,And the effect of making the prosthesis,was very, very intense because you have to be buried alive,basically.,My main memories of Mark was like kind of reassuring him,because he had to have some life masks done,that up until that time, I think, were maybe the best ones ever,achieved.,We did everything involving Jesse. The main sequence was,Freddy,breaking out of his body at the end.,It took us like 11 weeks to build everything,forthis one sequence,and pretty much every cut of that is a different effect.,The different phases of the transformation,it was storyboarded, designed very specifically.,We designed several different concepts for Jesse's,transformation.,The blades growing... the eye in the throat.,Probably a little too reminiscent of ""American Werewolf in,London?,We had a dummy head of Jesse's face...,which actually Kevin Yaghefs girlfriend,played Freddy's eye looking up at the back of the throat,because she had a head small enough to fit inside our dummy,head.,I'd never seen anything like that. It was the most,extraordinary thing I had ever seen.,In Grady's death, lthought,it came out really well.,I thought that I was gonna get a major prosthetic slash.,I wanted to see this mist of blood all over the place,and we didn't quite get that.,We didn't have time to do...,proper makeup,and as an actor, you're like, ""Well, wait a minute,,you know, hook me up.,Let's do the mmole thing."" I don't know how to explain it,,but the rhythm of the movie, wnen I die it stunned everybody.,There's a lot of ""oohs"" and ""aahs"" and abrupt screams, you,know. And in that whole movie the whole theater was silent.,Despite its daring choices, the film prompted,the biggest debate in the history of the franchise.,You know, everybody says that ""Nightmare 2"" kind of,took a turn from the rest of the series,,but there was no rest of the series at the time.,I can remember,those awkward times on the set,,it just didn't feel right already.,I remember really bringing up the script issues and saying,,""This is really, really problematic. Especially the ending."",I do remember Freddy,coming out of a pool party and feeling like, ""Oh my God."",Wes objected to the fact that Freddy appears,when everybody's awake.,There are certain rules you don't break and in the,Wes Craven Bible, we broke a couple of rules.,If he's out someplace, just out in the open,and surrounded by big teenagers,,it's not going to have the power, you're just running,up against the wall right away as a director to make that scary.,The pool sequence I remember.,I think we were there for two weeks.,It was a lot of shooting. Chaos,and swimming and fire.,And I think there was more tension in terms of Jacques Haitkin,just struggling all the time to make the film look good knowing,there were things like this pool party that,just made absolutely no sense.,We were bound to some extent by the script.,New Line developed the script and we're hired to shoot pages.,We were all just basically trying to get the work done.,I do have a couple of bad memories of just going, ""This isn't,going to work, this scene. Why are we doing this scene?"",""You are all my children now."",""You're all my children now"" I think, was the phrase he made up.,He got into the character to the point Wnere the character,was telling him more about himself.,There comes a point when you're playing a character a lot,When you know more about him than anybody else.,You just have this sixth sense about mmafs,right and what's wrong.,What we were looking for at the end was to open up our film as,much as we could in a movie that could not afford visual effects,or big map paintings or big sets.,Lisa confronts Freddy to save her boyfriend,to save Jesse.,We found spectacular iron foundry that is so incredibly huge,that we don't have enough lights to light it.,There was a scene involving a mutant rat,and a mutant cat.,And I have to be honest, because I was working on ""Aliens"",I didn't pay too much attention and,those didn't turn out too good.,The same thing with the dogs from hell,,you know, with the masks on.,I was imagining them a little more frightening.,I did a robotic life mask for the very end,when I burn up in that.,This meltdown head that I built,,it was simple mechanisms with toothpicks and super glue,and dental acrylic and it was just thrown together,,but, to me it was this big huge thing we were building.,Awax bust was put under hair dryers andjust melted.,So, he melted away and that was the,only set up we had of that shot.,I save the hero.,Her character tumed out to be the backbone of the movie.,That's why she's the one that finally,confronted Freddy and won.,The character of Jesse is,,in theater and movies, a female pan.,I was the woman and Lisa was the man.,Ultimately, he finds love through a heterosexual encounter,,at the end, but they could just be good friends after that,,I don't know. (laughing),Lisa and Jesse could've been sort of the ""Will and Grace"",of the horror genre.,Then the coda comes,,you know, the famous Bob Shaye coda.,Back on the bus.,There was a guy underneath my chair with his hand basically,up inside my shirt ready to go like this at the end of the movie.,""It's all over."",We didn't have a happy ending on ""Nightmare 2"" either,,did we? We sent 'em off down on a bus to hell.,We kill 'em all.,I do believe that he survived. I don't think,they went off into the desert and burned him up or something.,He didn't go to Burning Man, let's put it that way.,Opening on November 1, 1985 to mixed reviews,Freddy proved his power at the box office,with numbers that New Line could not ignore.,At that time sequels would make 60, 50%,of what the original made,,so they were expecting that ""Nightmare on Elm Street 2"",they were hoping it would do 70% of what the first one did. it,ended up doing 150% ofwlwat the first one did.,""Nightmare on Elm Street"" was sold out in every theater in,New York for every show by 10:30 in the morning.,I don't think it was until after ""Nightmare 2"" came out and,we started seeing these huge numbers,that they realized that they had a franchise.,You saw a man who suddenly opened up andjust was,staring into the future,with the most shit-eating grin you ever saw.,""Nightmare on Elm Street 2"" rocked Europe because they,picked up on the whole psychosexual, homoerotic subtext.,They love that film in Europe.,I give New Line a lot of credit for the success of,the series because what they were,willing to do was not just do,the same thing over and over again.,It's pretty interesting that in that day and age,,as a sequel to a pretty successful film,,that they went that direction and made those choices.,Pretty ballsy. No pun intended.,I mean just to take the chances with the sequel,that they did was bravery or stupidity.,We definitely earned our share of criticisms of pretty much,everything from,the nature of the film to the execution of the film.,We were trying to do something different, something original that hadn't,been done in the first one. it was clear that it didn't work as well.,It's always hard to do a sequel,'cause the first one'sjust so good.,The second one was not quite as pure.,It was much more of a commercial piece.,I don't thinkWes communicated his displeasure with the thing to me directly,,but I realized that soon afierwards that it was really a bad idea. (laughing),it didn't have a unity to it, it just had a bunch of scenes,,which I thinkthe worst of the sequels or the worst moments...,of the sequels, were just kind of striking scenes,,but ""overall"" the story didn't often cohere very well.,I'm proud that I did the film. The film really was the film,that gave me a career as a film director.,Jack knew what he was doing.,We found out his next film, ""Hidden,"" an American classic.,Cracked Magazine sent me,'The 10 Gayest Horror Movies Ever Made,',and ""Nightmare on Elm Street 2"" was #1.,That I wear like a badge of honor.,I'm so proud to be pan of that, (laughing) I really am.,That makes me really happy. Cool.,The experience of making ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" was,wonderful.,Even ifClu didn't get a blowjob (laughing) on the set.,One day I did discover a hand in my trousers, but I just,thought, ""Boys will be boys."" (sighing) Hmm.,Aware of Freddy's potential, but dismayed by the lukewarm,reception irom critics and fans alike,,New Line Cinema was determined to get their franchise back,on track, by recruiting some old friends and some new blood.,""2"" had its serious difficulties,,although it did well just based on the reputation,and the growing interest in this storyline,and particularly in Freddy.,Even though it was a successful film in terms of box ofﬂce,,it was a great disappointment, so I thinkthere was a,huge amount riding on what to do in ""Nightmare 3."",On every ""Nightmare"" I would go back to Wes Craven and,ask him if he was interested, so Wes wrote the,original script for ""Nightmare 3."",I wanted to take it up to the next level. I felt like if I'm going,to do another one I want it to be somehow better.,I came up with the idea and then,Bruce Wagner and I wrote, I think,,a really interesting first draft.,It had a lot of good stuff in it,and I think Wes did less of the writing and Bruce did more.,I was just about to start shooting ""Deadly Friend."",I'd go away into pre-production and,Bruce would be (typing sound).,But it didn't quite work. it was a very ambitious script,,but it didn't have,a lot of the human vulnerabilities and,the characteristics we wanted.,There were no rules. Everybody could do everything.,So it was just the kitchen sink thrown in and all the really,elemental, scary things that in ""Nightmare 1"",had worked so well, was just,,it felt like, ""I'm just gonna throw a bunch of junk in,'k was good for mat it was..,Wejust believed it needed more.,We were in the process of rewriting that script with Wes,when our producers at the time had met with,some young, smart up-an-coming writer-directors,,Frank Darabont and Chuck Russell.,And they said, ""Please hear their pitch. They have a,great pitch. We thinkthis is the best way to go."",When I convinced Bob and Sara that Chuck was the guy,,that he was going to be able to write a really good scnpt for it.,The whole series was in question. They really didn't know,ifth ey wanted to continue,,so I was pushing the company itself. Let's make the third,more fun, let's take,the boundaries of imagination a little bit further,in the whole series.,I give Chuck complete credit for wrhat happen ed with the script,in ""Nightmare 3."" -- he and Frank Darabont.,The original script to ""Elm Street 3"" was darker and,actually profane. I think Wes was trying to take it even into a,more horrific place.,And I was much more interested in the imaginative,element to the piece.,In fairness to the others who participated,,Frank Darabont and his partner,,they did some great stuff to it.,And they changed the game completely.,But, the script came in and it's like, ""Holy shit, this is huge."",This is like a $20 million script that nowwe have to make.,The budgets involved in the series, that was another limitation, but,you know, that brings out the best in you. I think every filmmaker,has to kind of rise to the occasion when you,start your career on a limited budget.,Despite Wes Craven's eany departure from the project, another,familiar face would make a welcome return to Elm Street.,Bringing Nancy back was another hook that I thought,was great for the series.,Wes Craven called me and asked if I would mind if he included,my character in a script he was writing for ""Nightmare 3"" and he,gave me the basic idea ofhow she comes back,and is a psychologist for kids,who are having these terrible nightmares.,It took some convincing. She had other things,going on in her life at the time, but she did a great job,and the character became a leader of sort of,a new generation of ""Elm Street"" kids.,You've got this great gimmick of,Heather as the binding element,Heathers the one that's been through it,and can tell them all mmats going on,""You are the last of the Elm Street children."",The cast was just sensational, all these,young actors were so good,,which made this particular film stand out from,other horror films at the time.,""Kincaid, an enormous and powerful-looking 17-year-old with a,shaved head is huddled in the corner of a white padded room."",It was a well-built, muscular guy and I looked in the mirror and,looked at me and said, ""Oh, hell no."" So... (laughing),But my agent talked me into going anyway. So I had to catch,the bus and get to the audition. It was just pouring down rain,,it was running late and I was getting pissed.,So when I went in the director said,,""Just do whatever you want to."",And I said, ""Fuck you!"",And that's how I got it. I cussed his ass out. (laughing),""Pan to Joey, a wan 16-year-old watching them,fiom around the comer.,'He has a tear drop drawn in ink under one eye?',In preparing for the role of Joey,,I had no lines until the very end of the script.,The characterwas completely mute.,Showing as much as I could with my eyes.,""Jennifer, a girl of 14, approaches. She extends her hand for,inspection -- it is scarred with cigarette burns."",There wasn't a lot of rehearsal for the role.,That was something we all had to do on our ovm.,I just tried to connect with the,emotional state of that character.,""Taryn, a 17-year-old girl, approaches.,She appears exhausted, dark tired circles under her eyes."",How I approached the characterwas,pretty much in the moment.,She has a drug problem. I think she has something hidden.,She has some kind of secret.,""All the kids of the Adolescent Care Unit are gathered:,Kincaid, Phillip, Taryn, Joey, Jennifer, and VIﬂII,,a 17-year-old confined to an electric wheelchair."",I have to tell you, growing up I played,so much Dungeons & Dragons,,I really felt secure with the aspect of the Wizard Master.,I mean, I was meant to play this role.,The cast member that stuck out to me was Patricia Arquette.,It was her first film. There was something so interesting,and so haunting about her.,And I think that's always been a special gifi for her,in her other work as well.,At least a third of the male cast fell in love with Patricia.,“Know Rodney',was in love with Patricia.,I'm mean like lovelorn.,He had mad affection for Patricia Arqu ette, you know. He didn't,talk in the film but his ass was talking off the film. (laughing),It was so funny because they were all coming to me for advice,,like, you know, I was dating her or something.,Nobody had a crush on me.,Everybody was in love with somebody else.,I think it also helped us off-set. We all became good friends.,I wanted to do something about,the bonding of kids at that age.,I think the beauty of the uvhole ""Elm Street"" series is that,there's something the kids know that their parents don't believe.,In ""Nightmare 1"" and ""3"" Wes really explores why,authority figures are trying the best they can and are failing.,At that time there was kind of a movement of such places,that even advertised on television,,""Send us yourtroubled child and we'll make them okay."" And,,essentially, they were like prisons or, you know, insane asylums.,(screaming),""Take her to a quiet room and sedate her."",A lot of afﬂcionados of the show would come up and say,,""Why were you so mean?"" And I'd think, ""Was I mean?,I didn't mean to be mean."" (laughing) Because,I had thought ofher as a very respectable person,who was doing her best.,So I thought I was a good guy.,It was a great horror riff on adolescence, on the point in our lives,vlmen we all realize the world is not such a nice place, and maybe,everything weve learned in school or our parents have told us,isn't exactly true.,One of the worst threats to them is the parents,,(laughing) the ""good intentions"" of the parents.,When it happens in ""Nightmare 3"" where Kristen,is, like, in her bedroom and her mom has some guy over,,""Honey, I've got a guest."",""And you don't want to keep him waiting."",it's just tawdry and it's sad.,My daughter 'Fiffany and I had a difficult relationship.,She was a teenager at the time, and, interestingly enough,,she has done several horror movies herself.,So I used it, I just kind of fell into that mode of ""mom with,teen age daughter“ thing that really didn't require a lot of acting.,And there's just something so real about that scene.,Every time I look at it, I'm like, ""Whew."" (sighing),I do believe that my character was definitely,part of the mob that went after Freddy.,Elaine was guilt-ridden and she had,this kind of bravado to cover it up.,But deep dovm inside, it's like,,""Oh my God, what have I done?"",I got demoted from,Lt. Thompson to a security guard with suggestions of,being a little bit of a drunkard, I think.,He realizes that he's made the wrong choices,regarding his daughter.,I think he realizes right there that he's ruined Nancy's life.,He was a broken man as a result ofvmat had happened.,And that leads to his sense of failure as a man and as a father.,""Fred Krueger is dead."",It touched a little bit on the idea of,suicide in the young.,Young people and suicide is a tremendous question.,Looking back now, there was a whole lot,of suicide movies in the '80s. There really were.,I thinkthe ""Nightmare"" series, it's a message to parents,to please listen to your kid. Your kid's not crazy,,your kid's not making stuff up.,To me that was the metaphor of ""Elm Street,"" and,""Dream Warriors"" took it just a step further.,While the young cast immersed themselves in their roles,,the team of special effects wizards behind ""Nightmare 3"",found themselves faced with a mmole new set of challenges.,I read the script and loved it because it was just full of effects.,And I kind of pitched to them, ""Listen, I'll do the movie,,but I want to do all the effects."",And they were stupid enough to do it. No, they actually were,really kind enough to give me the mmole show.,It looked like the script was going to be more fantasy,,you know, and fun.,I had to make it magical. I was going to be the one who was,going to give it the look.,All the money that was spent was not spent on anything other,than effects. Effects got everything.,There was an image with a roasted pig on a table that was a,kind of a classic, nightmarish image.,All of a sudden this pig said, (growling pig),(screaming),The budget was astronomical for making an animatronic pig.,We ultimately just roasted a pig and let it spoil and,the prop guys had to choose straws,as to who got to puppet it from beneath.,The pig absolutely stunk.,But ultimately it looks gnanier because it's real.,I can still,smell that pig to this day.,My main job for ""Nightmare 3"" was,the baby in the beginning of the film.,Patricia Arquette is running through the house,and she rescues the little girl.,And when I met with Chuck Russell and I asked him kind of,what he was looking for, he told me two words.,He goes, ""ThinkAuschm/itz."",And I did a life-size sculpture of the 5-year-old girl,that was emaciated and shriveled,and skeletal,,I spent 10 weeks constructing this mechanical puppet,,which is very realistic in detail.,When they brought it in to Chuck and I,it was so terrifying and so grotesque and horrific that,we felt like it just, we shouldn't do it.,And they never even rolled film on it.,I think they ended up having a prop guy super glue some,fake skeleton together in about 10 minutes.,So they used that.,Well the biggest challenge for ""Nightmare on Elm Street 3"",was probably the snake sequence.,The scene with PatriciaArquette and the worm monster,is often mentioned as a wild point in the picture.,That was a really exciting thing for me because it was,the first, you know, gigantic puppet I've ever made.,When I first saw the prop,I was stunned, because it was very, very phallic.,Chuck and I started laughing when we saw it.,I said, ""You think what I think?"",He just said, ""This looks like a penis."" And I said, ""Yeah,,remember we talked about it? We had meetings about this."",He said, ""I can't do that. We can't make it look like a penis."",I immediately called in the set painters and said, ""Look, at least change,the color."" (laughing) We tried to throw the thing into blues and greens,so it wouldn't be quite so Freudian.,That monster was wonderful in concept an.,In reality, it was a big prop that was actually a bit dangerous.,""Ready? Go!"",(screaming),It was really a scary thing to watch Patricia being eaten by that.,It was huge and so she was like in there.,We did a lot of reverse in those days.,In fact, when Patricia Arquette's being eaten by the snake,,she's actually being pulled off.,The whole piece actually looked quite good that way.,It gave it an eerie, dreamy aspect. But really we did it,that way because the prop didn't work.,But also, we had three or four different puppets. We had,one that swallowed Patricia that was only like 6 feet long.,Then we had one that was even longer for this overhead shot,,then he regurgitates her. That was another one.,And then the final one was this,whole mechanical thing that was a big,,huge snake that kind of rears up and,it was a radio-controlled face.,Knowing how much work went into that and knowing,how diff cult it was to kind of get that thing to set,,I would've gone and bowed on hands and knees to him then,because it was really an imaginative, really unusual effect.,'The puppet sequence -‘,mmere the marionette that's hanging on the wall,turns into Freddy,then he severs himself off,and then grows to be normal size --,that was pretty creepy.,We actually made,a series of heads that we would, in camera, dissolve,from one head to the next.,Bradley and the marionette,tendons, you know,,people just love that imagery.,It was done by Greg Cannom -- my old boss --,and he did a fantasticjob.,I also remember Bradley Gregg during lunchtime,just looked like spaghetti sauce all over him,and spaghetti arms.,Eating lunch, you know, as if it was no problem.,And he's sitting next to me and they had to,roll the veins so they didn't like get knotted or anything.,I'm sitting next to him reading and I'm just looking at him, going,,""Oh My God, Oh My God, Oh My God. Oh, this is awful."",The work that Greg and everyone did in effects,was absolutely extraordinary.,And the funny thing you have to remember about this film,is virtually everything was done physically on it.,You know, in a way we're responsible for making the Freddy,character a little bit more of a pop character.A media character.,And the Dick Cavett scene was a big part of that.,We spent a half a day shooting,Dick Cavett and he said, ""Well they told me I could pick,whoever I wanted.,So I picked Zsa Zsa Gabor because I think she's,the dumbest person I've ever met in my life,and I'd never have her on my show.,And if there was one person I would want to see killed,by Freddy, it would be her."",(screaming),My other favorite kill from ""Nightmare 3"" was,when Penelope Sudrows character was lifted up,by the TV set with the great line,,""Welcome to prime time, bitch."",(screaming),""Welcome to prime time, bitch."",""Welcome to prime time, bitch."",""Welcome to prime time, bitch."",(laughing) Really a priceless line.,It was just classic.,""Welcome to prime time, bitch"" was not a scripted line.,That was from Ruben.,That which, you know, was a modification of the original line,because it didn't quite fit in my mouth, but people love that.,The one-liners and Robert's delivery of them, made the film,,I think, a little more popular.,I actually enjoyed that scene,when they had,the mechanical arms come out and grab me.,That was, like, my favorite pan,just to scream.,(screaming),(laughing) That was great.,We had to basically make a vacu-form,puppet head that I made.,It would come out of this TV. We always had to use cut-aways,,so we'd cut-away and it was Robert's head,sticking through the TV (laughing),with antennas on his head. It was pretty hokey.,People have said that's their favorite death scene,of the series.,It's just a great kind of surreal, surreal,""Nightmare on Elm Street"" '80s moment.,Having met his match in the form of the ""Dream Warriors,"",Freddy Krueger became even more resourceful in,finding ways to prey on his victim's darkest fears.,What ""Nightmare on Elm Street Pan 3"" did was,it went to the logical conclusion ofhow Freddy,would operate within your subconcious and haunt you.,Freddy is in there with those private thoughts, with those,private fears. He knows what makes you tick.,He knows what he can use against,you because he gets in there.,My characters,weakness was always women and not much has changed.,One of the more memorable moments from the film is,the sexy nurse scene where Freddy is using,kind of a sexuality trap in a dream.,The one character that we spent the most time,interviewing and auditioning was the nurse,who has to bare her breasts.,I had to go in and strip, which, you know, isn't easy, but,that was the process. It was a little out of the norm.,She would have to stand there naked and stufffor,the lighting and stuff. It was a pleasure.,I've had guys tell me, ""Watching that scene was the first thing,that really got me interested in girls and you've changed my life."",That's very ﬂattering, and, wow.,That's amazing.,The physical effect of switching the nurse with Freddy was,something we tried in a makeup effect that got a little too,out of control and it wasn't exactly right.,What Chuck Russell wanted was,her to have the head of Freddy and then,have it trail off into this beautiful woman.,Freddy with breasts,,it was too ofi-kilter.,Somehow the imagery was just,,it didn't quite go.,Again, this was one of those points that no one,can play Robert like Robert.,And it just looked like a gin with a Freddy face on,,you know, talking like Robert.,It just didn't quite work.,The spitting of the tongues,was really just a small piece of,,it was like a type of latex that was rolled up.,I would open my mouth and,do this barking thing.,The tongues,were extraordinary.,You could stand right next to them and look at them,and the puppeteering was so good that,you couldn't see any phoniness to it whatsoever.,That was actually shot in a room that they built sideways,,so I had to climb up on a ladder and be strapped to the bed.,Standing up.,That's what kills you in a crucifixion. Eventually, your heart,can't pump blood to your extremities, so I,actually passed out while I was up in this contraption.,And I also think it's Wnythey hire young actors to be in all,these horror movies, 'cause they can take the abuse.,The one I remember the most is when,Jennifer Rubin got killed.,It was kind of the time when punkwas really hot.,We were developing the character still,,so I hadjust walked up to Chuck Russell and said,,""Can I do this hairdo?"" And he said, ""Sure."",That line that she says,,""In my dreams, I'm beautiful...,and bad."",Oh my God, I mean, talk about one of the,worst lines you would ever have to say on film.,One of the funniest things was,Taryn was in her full-blown makeup,,we went to a Chinese restaurant for dinner (laughing),and it was hysterical, because the way that people,were looking at her, you would've thought that,she was like an alien from a different world.,She ordered the chop suey with a look in her eyes,and they backed off. It was very funny.,I have a little bit of a problem being emotional.,""Let-s dance."",lfl get into it, I kind of will try to kill you.,I remember I did stab him once (laughing),when we were really fighting and I got him.,Track marks on her arms,turning into sucking little mouths was just brilliant.,Incredible stuff. Absolutely incredible stuff.,""Lars get high,"" (hissing),Jennifer Rubin's sequence,with an exploding head didn't quite make it to film.,""3, 2, 1. Oh no!"" (laughing),They didn't figure out how to work,my special effect.,Freddy's hypodermic needle fingers,was my little anti-drug statement that is,very, was very effective.,I got a lot of fan mail from people,having quit drugs because of her.,It touch es my heart to be remembered,that way because,this girl fights and never says die. But then I had to.,""I am the Wizard Master!"",I was a pre-Harry Potter.,And that was, again, the greatest thing about,my character being a Wizard Master.,And having played Dungeons & Dragons,,I was able to conjure up the spells.,That wheelchair,was huge. And it was so huge,,it virtually could not get dovlm the hallway.,It had been built too large,,but it looks,really frightening when you see it in the film.,But there was also difficulty,because Freddy's claws were not retracting,,so they put a 2-by-4 right by my heart, underneath my cape,and I was just praying to God that Robert,made sure that he hit it. (screaming),I did get to show off who I was and I got to use my power,,mmich I felt was pretty important, you know,,you get to see exactly what these kids get to do.,Whether they got killed or not, that's a mmole different story.,Faced with a grueling production schedule,,diff cult working conditions and an overburdened,first-time director, tensions on the set of,""Nightmare 3"" began to rise.,Chuck came in with this massive passion,,but what came out of that,was how difficult it was to work with Chuck. (laughing),They were very touchy about the imagery of,Freddy Krueger and where we took it,,and I was trying to, frankly, loosen them up, you know,,and take it into a crazier place,and move it further, or there's! be no point.,He was getting a lot of frustration,from the powers that be over him.,It was just a really hard shoot.,I think there was more tension,on that set than any set I've ever been on.,I think Chuck really had his hands full.,We were always hours and hours,behind because the stuff was so difficult.,Lots and lots of effects.,Diff cult effects.,Chuck Russell, he was really somebody with,tremendous detail,with everything. Didn't let anything slide.,There was a couple of times, for me, that I think Chuck,did not know how speak to some ofus actors.,I don't think he had a great deal of,experience before doing that film.,You were aware that there was,this expectation of you,to do certain things, but you just,didn't really kn ow what they were.,It was Patricia Arquette's first film and,the first night that she shot,,we didn't get to her 'til 4 in the morning.,She couldn't remember her lines.,We did 52 takes with her and still couldn't get it right.,She just couldn't do it, you know. We had to do cue cards.,She really rose to the game, but Chuck,never got over that original discomfort,and never really gave her the support,that I thought that she deserved.,One thing about, I think, maybe any ""Elm Street"" film,is you're trying to take young performers and get,'that sense ct tension, get the tear, take them to the edge..,And it's not an easy kind of film to make.,The dream set at the end, kind of the climax of the film,,was kind of an elaborate boiler room set,that was stretching the limits,for what we could do on budget and time.,I just remember it was like they, literally, cut,the air conditioner ofiand it was,crowded in there, it was hot.,Those scenes are hard because there's,lots of fire, lots of smoke.,That smoke smells really bad.,Always the fire department was,on our rear end. Always threatening to,close us dovm.,It was mayhem.,If we could have photographed behind the scenes,what was happening, it would have been a bigger circus,than what was in front of the camera.,And I remember, at one point,,the tension on the set was so thick,that one of the producers stopped,the whole shooting and he called,everybody together and he went to the top of the,stairs and he said, ""This shit is going to stop."",After the 21st hour one day, I said,,""Chuck, can you define for me what is a director?"",And he said, ""The last man standing."",And I've never heard a better definition.,We put in long hours, but it was interesting.,Everyone had their hearts in it.,And I think the results are on the screen.,The junkyard scene was filmed,very late at night, early morning.,I think I was there until 3:30 or so.,The sun almost began coming up.,Frank Darabont, who co-m/rote that script with me,,and I are both,big Ray Harryhausen fans, so we found,a way to get our little homage,to Harryhausen with,bringing Freddy's skeleton to life.,We decided to build a skeleton and found how diff cult it was,to build a stop-motion skeleton.,I wish he'd had Ray there because,maybe we could have done a better job of it.,We used Robert Englund's attitude,,his posture and stuff for the Freddy skeleton,as much as we could so it looked like him.,I don't remember how they did it, but they,must have put me on some sort of a dolly,going toward this Cadillac fender in the back,,the tail which pierced me.,I must say I didn't like the scene.,""3"" was the first time when you see the souls,of children. This is an effect where all the souls,that are trapped inside of Freddy make,an appearance on his body.,The screaming souls on Freddy's chest was something that,we didn't really know we could pull off,,but that particular effect,actually is a quite haunting, strange,concept that worked well.,It was actually a chest piece that fit under Robert's,own chest. It was about 3 inches thick and inside,there were cables that came out the back of him and all that.,And they blinked the eyes and moved the jaws and all that stuff.,""It's a dead end."",One of the very toughest things, strangely, was,the mirror sequence, the mirror hallway.,My character screams and,breaks all the mirrors and,it turns out that my dream power is my voice.,Mirrors shattering in that hallway was a really huge effect.,And this is before CGI, so we had to get very inventive.,I mean, unbelievably technically diff cult.,It was something we ended up getting done,at the optical house, at the last minute,,literally manipulating mylar in front of a camera.,That sequence and where Freddy gets blown apart,were two very, very complicated sequences.,We had to build this puppet head,'and this 'make thing was mechanical.,And then, later, the guys, the optical guys, went in there,and rotoscoped light pouring out of him,and that's how he sort of just tore apart,with the light of God.,They had to bury Freddy in the hallowed ground,,that made sense.,And so Chuck understood sort of the,religious connotations and things like that.,I wanted to bring in these kind of,classic Christian values almost.,We kill Freddy with a cross.,I mean, this is old school vampire stuff.,""Nightmare on Elm Street 2"" was, I guess,,the gayest horrorfilm ever made and,""Nightmare on Elm Street 3"" was the Christian version.,I think in doing the third one I knew,we had to fill in a little bit of the Freddy backstory.,And in the ""Elm Street"" series that means,it has to be something big and dangerous.,I love the idea that,some twisted DNA somehow made,its way into this poor little nun,,Amanda Krueger, who got the Christmas shifi,in the asylum, getting raped by a hundred maniacs.,""Freddy?!"",""The bastard son of a hundred maniacs."",And this was just one of the ideas that came out,that we realized was appropriate,,but, in a way, dangerous to put on film.,It's always a balancing act between,how much you're going to reveal the monster,and how much you're going to keep mysterious.,V\ﬂth his dark history revealed and his bones laid to rest,,the time had come for Freddy's final reckoning.,But if Krueger had to go, he would take with him,one of Elm Street's finest.,""Die!"",Heather being killed offis not that unusual.,If the original characters were in the sequel,,usually they didn't last until the end because,they either aged or the studio would feel like,now we have to have new characters.,I do believe that it's very appropriate that,Nancy dies at the end of,It's almost like killing a recurring character,or a regular off of a television show,,and it takes some courage.,Her dying off was in the original screenplay,and it was a bold thing to do.,She goes out heroically, which is, I think, very fitting.,All stories of heroes have to come to an end and,I thought that the way that she died,in Patricia's arms was very touching.,But I knew it would in crease kind of the,whole suspense and jeopardy.,If Nancy can die, anything can happen in the series.,Now that Krueger had been vanquished,,at least for the moment,,the filmmakers wanted to find a way to,market Freddy to the masses.,There is something naturally heavy metal,about Freddy Krueger.,And there was a sudden opportunity to use Dokken.,I just moved out fiom Tampa, Florida.All I knew was Dokken.,Doing the movie was kind of like ourwhole career:,50% talent, 50% luck.,It was specific. It had to be called ""Dream Warriors"" and try,to make it spooky and the lyrics should be about the movie.,I still remember my version -- it didn't make it.,Mine was (singing), ""Dream warriors,,we can be heroes inside of our dreams."",Which is exactly why it didn't get accepted. (laughing),That's how it went, yeah. (laughing),The Dokken video was kind of ahead of its time.,We were at the eany end of MTV and it was,kind of the perfect opportunity to take,heavy metal and horror and make one,nasty thing out of it.,It was cutting edge, you know.,Nobody had done it,and we were like the first band to do that,,you know, all that stuff and mix it with the movie.,I thought it was the greatest video.,It really helped our careers.,And, in fact, ours was the first video,ever included on a VHS of a movie. First one.,I can't sing the song anymore.,(singing) ""...forever."",It's so high.,Even vmen I did it and I was young --,I was probably SO-something, in my eany 30s --,it just was too frickin' high.,(singing) ""Dream warriors"",(singing) ""We're the dream warriors...,(singing)""Don't want to dream no more."",(singing) ""And maybe tonight, maybe tonight,you'll be gone. Dream warriors."",I have a platinum record from that Dokken song.,That is one of the few prop things that's,actually up in my house,because it's so funny that I could,possibly have a platinum record ever,with my mmite, Jewish rhythm.,I've never gone anywnere, or performed anywhere,,any of us, where we either don't see the EP,or an album, or get asked to do the song.,It's just part of our legacy.,""What a nightmare!"",""Dream Warriors"" was released on February 27, 1987.,Aimed straight at the mainstream, ""Nightmare 3"",paved the way for Freddy Kruegerto become,a household name.,I felt like, honestly, it couldn't be more frightening than,what Wes did in the original, but I thought adding an element,of wit and black humor would balance out,some of the really dark imagery in the piece.,The fact that they made Freddy more and more jokey,,took him farther and farther away fiom that child molester thing,that just kind of sticks to you in a way maybe you don't like.,I think there's a great combination between horror and humor.,And it always goes that way,,it doesn't matter how scary your first film is.,They really walked a fine line with it.,It was never cheesy or campy, it was always with a purpose.,It's why ""3"" was a little bit of a surprise for the series and for the,fans and I think maybe hard to get exactly right after that.,There's only so much you can do with Freddy's comedy,before it becomes too much.,After ""2"" there were not a lot of people that really thought,that it was going to be successful.,So it was really up to Chuck to make it successful,,and I think he made it successful.,""For the very first time in history, a small, independent film,has swept the weekend box office grosses."",""The number one movie in the country last week. In Syracuse they,called in the mounted police to control the crowds at theaters."",It was in the Top 10 grossers of the year that it came out.,That movie made a lot of money.,Seeing the audiences respond to it,,seeing the series become so successful,from that point on, was my payoff.,""Nightmare on Elm Street"" went from being cult,to being an international, huge success.,""The worst!"" ""Don't leave,home without it!"" (laughing),When Siskel and Ebert reviewed the film,they got into a heated debate on the show and,Roger Ebert was very adamant that he felt like the film,deserved an ""X"" rating.,Considering his movie is being pitched to teenagers and young teenagers. Don't talk,to me about the ""R"" rating, they know exactly who they want to see this movie."",'(shattered glass)',I have to say that over the years and having met,lots of fans all over the world, that I think,the fan favorite is ""Nightmare on Elm Street Pan 3."",I mean, more of my fans say they like that movie,than any of them.,""Dream Warriors"" is what the best franchise,sequels in any genre should be, because,it's a film that moves the franchise along,,adds to the mythology without taking anything auvay from,what's come before, and also manages --,and it is a very hard thing to do --,to maintain or reintroduce,characters that we already know and,care about while balancing them with new characters,that we ultimately actually care about just the same.,There were some successful ""Elm Streets"" after it,and some not so successful. But they were all,,from that point on, I think more imaginative.,We started getting into the groove, so to speak,,and everybody was wailing with ideas.,All the elements that worked in that,I was instrumental in trying to feed into the next scripts.,And I think we set the tone for the other sequels.,After ""Dream Warriors,"" Freddy's audience expanded,far beyond expectations and New Line Cinema,,like Freddy Krueger himself,,began growing by leaps and bounds.,By this time ""Nightmare"" had a reputation,and New Line had a reputation.,The company was really evolving into,less of an unstable,and uncertain entity,,into one that was very financeable.,Bob was very good at promoting.,I mean, in a way that Roger Corman did the same thing.,He was very good at promoting people who he thought,were smart and he thought supported the company.,He was building an empire,,he wasn'tjust making movies.,That was the New Line way. lfth ey liked you,,they lefi you alone.,They worked the crap off of you and,they didn't pay you a lot, but you knew,you were doing their next movie.,So if you got on that New Line boat,,that was a good ship to be sailing on.,The way I got involved in ""Nightmare on Elm Street 4"" was,very unusual and very complicated.,We had our pick really of directors, but, again,,we wanted young, hot, up-and-coming, cheap.,I had come,from Finland a few years prior to seek my fortune.,He and his pal were living out of,baked bean cans in a single room,in Hollywood somewhere.,I'd lost all my credit cards, all my money,,I was really down on my luck.,I had seen the movie he made.,I think it was called ""Prison."",It was made for about $1 million,and it had a lot of sort of homemade special effects.,I knew he would be great.,I met with him, I thought he was fantastic.,And after fifteen minutes Bob Shaye's like,,""Okay, goodbye."",And he pretty much throws me out of his ofﬂce.,Bob kept saying, ""He doesn't speak English."" (laughing),He said, ""It's not his main language."",I went five times back to New Line,,pretty much unannounced.,I didn't, you know, call an assistant and make an appointment,,I just would go and hang out in the lobby and,go to Bob Sh eye's office and say, ""Hi, I'm back."",And he's like, ""The Finnish guy? What is he doing here?"",And every time he'd come in for an interview he looked, frankly,,dirtier and dirtier and he'd wear the same clothes. And I,really think they started to smell.,He was like a Viking, you know,,this guy's huge. He had hair down to his ass.,And I thought, ""God, I've got to hire this guy,just to get him a bath."",We needed a director desperately and I knew it was,going to be a huge amount of work and,we decided, he's a big guy, you know (laughing),he probably has a lot o energy and he can work really,hard 24 hours a day for six weeks to get the film ready.,So they kind of compromised and finally said, like,,""Okay, you won us over. You can direct the movie."",I was very scared stepping into this movie.,It was my first sort of a Hollywood movie and,though it was only a $5 million budget,,for me it was gigantic.,Brian Helgeland wrote ""Nightmare 4"",and he was another hot, young,,up-and-coming writer that we could afford.,There was sort of a rough script, but a very,,very sort of like a blueprint for the movie.,And sooner than we knew, the writers' strike started.,""Nightmare 4"" was just this writers' disaster.,So a lot of it was really made up,,because we had no writer to write it.,Mostly I would come up with the nightmares,because I had an endless amount of nightmares,in my memories from my childhood.,He knew that he had to make the film more visual,and he had to up those stakes because,we didn't have as strong a script.,What I felt was very important was to,sort of reinvent the series.,From the very get-go I said,,""I feel that Freddy has sort of become,like James Bond of horror films,and we should make him, in a way,,the hero of the movie."",We saw a movie before the movie was made,,which was called,""Chinese Ghost Story."",We were inspired by the feel of it.,And this movie was really meant to be done in that,Hung Kong action style,,which is a lot of quick cuts, a lot of different shots.,Renny was like ahead of everybody on that film.,He totally understood the youth culture,,he was young himself.,He completely understood how to make the script work.,Looking to preserve the continuity of the previous film,Renny Ham“ sought out a new cast',of likeable young actors to team up with the last,of the ""Elm Street"" children.,The casting of the movie was an interesting process.,I wanted to see really ﬂ'esh faces in the film,,people that nobody had seen before.,""Alice is not especially well put together.,And yet there's something about this,shy-loooking girl that suggests that,she might be incredibly attractive if she had any confidence."",I was that gin. I uvas that shy girl.,I thought I would never have a boyfriend.,Alice was a daydreamer,,that was mmere she felt most comfortable.,In her mind, imagining being with the hunky Dan.,""Alice's attention drifts to a tough pick-up,that is pulling up not far from them.,A handsome, dark-haired teenager,,Dan, climbs out of the car."",Well, they made a joke, because they,gave me the pan pretty eany on and the script-,I don't know if his name was Dan - they were like,,""Just call him Dan, that'll work."",At first I was, like, man, these guys think,I'm so bad, they're giving me,my own name so I answer to it. (laughing),I didn't know I was going to be in the,film until my agent called and,told me there was a script for ""Nightmare on Elm Street 4"",and I was in it.,They forgot to kill me in ""Pan 3"" so that's why,they brought me back in ""Part 4."" (laughing),Oh, they let the black man live? (laughing),We'll fiX that.,I would tell my friends, ""If you're going to the movie,to see me in ""Part 4,"" go straight to the theaters,,don't get no popcorn, don't get no drinks or nothin',,'cause my ass will be dead by the time you sit down."",I remember our disappointment in ""Nightmare 4"",that we couldn't get Patricia Arquette.,She had been such an integral pan to ""Nightmare 3"",and people liked her so much.,I'm not 100% sure why Patricia Arquette did not return.,To this day, I don't know why.,I don't think there's any untoward reason,,I think maybe she was busy.,Patricia was already starring in other movies then,and it just simply may have been a conﬂict.,Maybe her agents,wanted too much money and Bob Shaye,didn't want to pay and said, you know,,Bob Shays-style, ""Screw you."",They just wouldn't pay her the money that she asked for, and,it was very little and definitely what she deserved.,""Kristen, a beautiful, but pensive-looking blonde teenager,,is walking slowiy towards the ominous house."",I think stepping into that role,at first I was nervous, 'cause I'm like,,""I'm not Kristen. Oh no."",You know, ""I'm not Patricia Arquette."",The chemistry between Tuesday Knight was not as great,as it was with Patricia Arquette.,""Hi guys."",It was quite difficult to do a scene,that was a heartfelt reunion on the page,with somebody I hadn't worked before.,I would have loved to have seen what that movie,could have become had Patricia Arquette participated in it.,We ran into Jim Cameron, so Renny's quite,excited and he introduces himself,and Jim says, ""Well, so how are you resurrecting Freddy this,time?"" And Rennyjust looks at him and goes,,""A dog pisses fire."",Renny was really the one who,did the mmole dog pee thing to resurrect Freddy,,mmich was, what a great way, right?,Someone just pees on it,,he's back.,I'm a dog lover, so it just came naturally, this whole dog idea.,Because it is an animal,and another animal,together with the pee.,It's lovely.,It comes out beautiful when you do it that way.,That's some strong pee.,(laughing) He had a urine infection like hell.,I think that a dog peeing on Freddy is, you know,,again it's mythic. It's like, if you start to examine that,and you want to be intellectual,,it's a hound from hell.,Freddy come back, why you runnin'?,Piss on his ass.,""Hows this for a wet dream?"",The sequence that was maybe one of the,more challenging ones was the water bed sequence.,I really did appreciate my death scene,,and again, at the hands of a beautiful naked woman.,Always my weakness.,That bedroom was built on about a 4 foot high,platform with,a water tank that was the actual water bed.,Very complicated. I don't know how we pulled it off.,And it was one of those scenes where,everybody was getting fiustrated.,""It's like 20-something takes. You guys have been shooting this,for 6 fucking hours. if you can't get it, it's your problem."",There was definitely tension on the set on that day,,but in the end it worked out perfectly.,Ken and Tuesday and I were the last of,the ""Elm Street"" children and to just sort of summarily,wipe us out,at the beginning,of ""Pan 4"",just felt like a real sort of cheap trick.,What were we going to say, you know?,We're going to go up to Bob Shaye and say,,""Look, we want to be in the whole movie."",it was on page 11 , I think is when he got rid of me.,Should've got rid of me on page 2.,Kristen's death scene was kind of bizarre.,There was a beautiful beach,,palm trees and all that, and she's,suntanning herself there,and Freddy turns into a shark.,Renny wanted my bathing suits to be like the size of a,,like string, so I put it on and go,,""There's no way that I'm coming out like this. There's no way."",And he goes, ""Oh Tuesday, your buttocks looks beautiful.,You come out like that."",And I want to get this shot and I get really pissed off at Tuesday,,I'm like, ""Come on,"" you know. And she's like, ""I can't, I can't."",I'm like, ""No, I'm not coming out!"",""No, no, it's beautiful. No, it brings love."",It's not because I'm some, you know, sex pervert,,but I know what teenage boys want to watch.,So they had to sew,a little thing. That's why I had that little Hawaiian job.,I do remember that just to stay with,the sort of superhero concept with Freddy,,I said, ""Let's give him sunglasses."",Almost like now he's like Tom Cruise.,Which was again, it was kind of like,against all the rules of the ""Nightmare"" movies.,After that, we cut to the scene where, you know, I'm,in the big fight With him,and so, I mean,,'she does sort of go down in sort of',a blaze of glory.,It's kind of too late for her, but then she does pass it on,to Alice.,Alice did take on the qualities of her friends,as they were killed.,You could really see that arc in the character,in the course of the movie.,Somebody I could make seem timid and,vulnerable in the beginning,and who can then, in a believable way,,become kind of like,Sigourney Weaver in ""Aliens"",or something like that.,Poor Lisa. I just remember her being so shiny,and they were always, always powdering her,because she was exerting so much energy because she,was so physical in that one.,They did send me,off to a day of karate school.,I was terrified I was going to hit myself,in the head with nunchucks.,And I've heard this comment so many,,it's like, ""The wig was so bad,,it doesn't even look like,Alice from the back."",That's all acting, you know,,'cause she's really kind of,like a femme fatale in real life.,Your villain, to put a ﬂip on a famous adage,,is only as good as his hero. And when we look at,the best of these franchises, be it ""Dream Warriors"",or ""The Dream Master,"",in which case he fighting against a capable hero,,those are the ones the fans generally like the best.,""Nightmare 3"" and ""Nightmare 4"" has been,the highest making movies. I ain't braggin',but those were the two I was in.,One of the cool things about ""Nightmare 4"",is it's sort of a who's who of makeup effects.,I had done makeup effects for,""Prison"" and so I got a call,from Renny saying, ""Would you like to do this film?"",Yeah, okay, sure, absolutely.,I liked working with Ren ny. He was very creative,and really began to push what we could do,live, in camera.,I ended up passing the makeup off to,Howard Berger.,""Here, go make Robert up for the next six weeks.,And you can hear all his stories."",I was very polite and so I was waiting for Robert to finish talking,before I would do stuff.,But Robert talks and talks and talks and talks.,""I saw Barbra Streisand in New York,,my first time she was singing,,she was still singing like small clubs."",I've heard every Robert Englund story ever.,I mean, by year three or four I would sit there,,I could finish them for him.,""I ﬂew, no one grabbed me, and 37 stitches.,I thought my careerwas over."",I could just say, ""No, no, rest your voice."",""So, this is uvhat happen ed to Robert when he did this movie."",There would be times where I, literally, wouldjust,put my arm on Robert's head and hold him,,you know, like put him in a headlock almost,,and do his makeup, you know.,'Cause Kevin said, ""Just get in there.,Just disregard what he has to say.,Justjump in and start doing the makeup."",It was a completely collaborative unit,that created those effects,and anybody could come in with,their ideas.,But they had no idea what the hell we were gonna,be doing, so we would brainstorm and figure,,""Well, what if we did this and what if this happened."",They would have a release date before they even had a script,,so we were just always up against the gun.,I think on ""Nightmare 4"" we, literally, were shooting something, I,want to say, like, two weeks before the movie came out.,Kevin called and was like,,""Oh, we've got a pickup to do."" And I'm like,,""The movie comes out next week,"" or whatever.,But it didn't matter, it's just the way those movies work.,I think I remember seeing the poster for ""Nightmare 4"",before we ever started shooting.,I was like, ""This is just insanity."",I was pretty beat up from other work,wnen I began ""Part 4"". I was committed, I just wasn't,completely behind the project, I think, with enthusiasm.,Atter the first week of shooting, When I cut some footage together,and showed it to everybody, I think everybody sort of woke up.,I went, ""Aha! this is the 'MTV' Nightmare."",It's energetic, it's kinetic.,They were using tricks and techniques, both in camera,and for post,,that I couldn't imagine.,I was so excited about seeing that, that I mean, I, literally,,got my second wind that night and for the rest of that shoot.,With Robert Englund back in the saddle again,,Freddy set his sights on fresh meat.,Once again, taking each of his victim's fears,to a mmole new level.,""The Black Girl looks a bit nerdy, with thick glasses short hair,,but makes up for it with a hip sense of style."",I loved my death scene.,(laughing) It was actually my first on-camera kiss.,The idea of the,hand coming through the desk,,I thought that uvas kind of,900W and,stupid.,Stupid.,It was like from another movie,,I don't know what I was thinking.,I was thinking ""Terminator"" or something.,And I just remember When he was coming towards me,,they said they had to use the real claws,because it was such an extreme close-up.,So they were really sharp.,And I just remember he pulled my skin with,the real claw,so when I was done with the day I had,these pin pricks all underneath my chin.,""Want to suck face?"" ""No."",When I said, ""No,"",he came dovm and his dentures ﬂew out of his mouth,,he was like this close, straight into my mouth.,And it was like saliva and probably what,he ate that day andjust crud.,I heard that Toy said something about us doing ADR,,looping her lines,because she didn't sound ""black"" enough.,Renny came up to me and he's like,,""You're going to redo all your lines."",And I was like, ""Excuse me?"",And he's like, ""Yeah, because you don't sound,like a black girl and this is not how a black gin is."",And it kind of pissed me off, to be quite frank.,And so I confronted him on it.,And, it didn't go so well.,I don't remember this. I'm from Finland.,What do I know?,I would deny it, too. Hell. (laughing),if that's true, that must have come from somebody else.,it sounds like Bob Sh aye.,When it finally came out, Rennywalked up to me,and he put his arm around me and,he's like, ""I didn't know any better. I'm really sorry,"" you know.,""You're getting some really good reviews,and thank you for challenging me on that."",""Rick, Alice's brother, is shimmying out of an,upper ﬂoor window and with surprising grace,,he maneuvers to the ground and lands,smiling in front of the girls."",First, Lisa and I were twins and then I was, I think,,I was supposed to live.,And then there was this very elaborate, cool death scene.,Originally what happened is he went into the elevator,and it was a nightmare elevator,and the elevator started falling apart and the walls came off,and he's like falling through space, darkness.,That was, literally, a scene mmere we ran out,of money. And nobody knewmmat to do,,how was he going to be killed and what's going to happen.,We were working with an unfinished script,that we were finishing while we were doing it.,Somebody said, ""Look, why does he have to die at all?,Let's just not even have the scene."",And then, well, we already shot the funeral scene,,he is dead, he's in the coffin.,And I said, ""Well, he should die in some kind of,martial ans scene, because we've already set that up."",We have no money to build any kind of a set,,so all we could do was hang these fabrics,and make it look like it's like Japanese or something.,One of the epic fails, I think, of the sequences in,""Nightmare 4"" is when Rick fights invisible Freddy.,The only death scene probably in any ""Nightmare on Elm,Street"" where Freddy is not actually there.,And I worked really hard for about two and a half, three weeks,just to get some basic skills dovm.,And then I got on the set and they pretty much said,,""No, no, no, we don't want that,"" you know.,It was just, they wanted all big roundhouse punches.,That's not karate at all, it's full-on John Wayne bullshit.,So cheaply done, and so kind of cheesy.,I mean, massively lame.,I'd had an appendix operation.,I ended up like,tearing my scars doing that scene and,had to go to the hospital for that.,I love the cockroach scene. That's great.,Youve got ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" where you go,,""lndy's frightened of snakes,"" right.,Okay, so what happens later on in the film?,He gets thrown in the snake pit.,So we have this character who's frightened of bu gs, right,,so what do you expect? You expect the same thing, you know, she's, gonna be taken over by tons of cockroaches. And, you know,,what we did was we completely turned it around and,we had her tum into a cockroach.,""Debbie Stevens, is one well put together item.,A tough but smart gin from the wrong side of the tracks."",I was working with Screaming Mad George,,who was the makeup artist,who did all of my cockroach stuff, and he,was just fabulous.,I don't even know why he's called,Screaming Mad George.,I think hejust came up with that,,you know, it's kind of crazy.,(giggling),The makeup was in credibly challenging.,Sitting in the seat for probably about,three and a half hours getting all of the,prosthetics put on and all of the makeup and,all of the blood,and all the guts that they had to attach.,And then I had these huge arms.,It was all very visceral, you know,,you had like tons of stretchy chunks of ﬂesh stuff,covered in slime,and covered in blood.,I remember doing it and feeling like,,""Oh my God, this is going to look so goofy,"",'cause the arms,were ﬂoppy and ﬂipping and ﬂopping,this and that way and nothing seemed to quite work.,When my arms break and fall off,it's only my head.,So I'm in a box, I'm like low in a box like that,,and on top is this big fake body that,I had to do a bodycast for.,So theyve got me all glued in, I'm all in this thing.,I sat in that box for,five hours and I finally was like,,""I have to pee."" (giggling),And they're like handing me a styrofoam cup.,I don't have a penis! I can't pee in the cup!,Can't do it, won't do it! Gotta get me out.,By building the set in a very specific way, making,it sort of a forced perspective set,and all that,,it actually sort of ended up being,kind of scary and surreal and weird.,I'm in goo in a cockroach,cast and they're paying me to do this.,I love, my favorite shot is Freddy looks,into the roach motel and it's his eye looking into it.,Ohhhhh, you know, in the roach motel,and, ""Splat!"",Working on the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movies are a,complete hoot because you don't just get to rip people apart,,you get to do things that are,imaginative and fun and surrealistic and it is an artist's dream.,The Rialto Cinema sequence is my,favorite scene in the movie. It was very hard to,accomplish the mmole sequence.,We built pan of the balcony,seaﬂng,sideways, so that she was actually hanging from the chair.,They mounted the camera on that balcony,and that mmole balcony turned,so it became vertical.,And I wanted it to sort of build slowiy with, you know,,things starting to ﬂy toward the screen,and the popcorn starts ﬂying,and the drink goes.,'And, of course, the hardest part was were',she actually hits the screen and kind of blends,and becomes pan of the movie.,You actually see her hit the screen and,go from a 3-dimensional person to a,Z-dimen sional movie and,that had never been done.,To me, it was like a movie lover's sequence and kind of,a homage to,cinema in general.,PlayingAlice - the one who never got married,(laughing) and never left the restaurant, old Alice -,we tried old-age makeup,and Renny didn't like it. So then, I think,we finally ended up using a prosthetic.,Thick, rubbery stuff glued on,to really get me looking old.,I came up with the idea of,the faces in the pizza.,We did the horror pizza,,the soul food.,""Rick, you little meatball."",We ordered from Domino's,,we took pictures of him,and did a clay press out of it. Sculpted all these,individual little meatball,heads.,And then we did a full-scale pizza with,the real actors' faces in it.,And we made them all move around, ""Aaahhhh."",You know, doing weird things.,(laughing) I remember when,he puts the fork into his,face and it just kind of goes like that,,it just worked so well.,My favorite sequence of all the,""Nightmare on Elm Street"" films,is in ""Part 4"" when,Lisa Wilcox leaves The Crave Inn. Get it, The Crave Inn?,""Come on, we have to hurry!"" ""What's going on?"",I remember coming up with this idea of a loop in the scene,where it keeps repeating itself and,that's how they figured out they were in a dream.,By the second time I'm in,the loop, I have an upset stomach,because I kn ow something bad's gonna happen.,""Come on, we have to hurry!"" ""What's going on?"",And that's just such a brilliant realization of a dream, to me.,When we sat down to think about the ending,and how to kill Freddy,,we, literally, said, ""Okay, well, how do monsters,get killed in movies?"" You can,chop them up,,you can shoot them,,you can bum them,,you can blow them up.,But what all those ways have in common is that,it's always a force coming ﬂ'om outside,that destroys the evil.,I brought in a picture of,""The Ecstasy of St. Theresa,"",which is this Bernini sculpture.,The expression on her face is of divine ecstasy,,of having seen God. And so there's a scene,she's supposedly defeated,and she looks up at these,little children who are like angels. And what we wanted,was the idea that in that moment,,God is filling her with ecstatic grace.,Then she could see him for what he was,,mmich was just evil and,,""just look at yourself, look how low you are."",That's howwe created the mmole idea of,these souls trapped inside Freddy and that,they're gonna be set free and they are from inside out.,They're gonna rip him apart and destroy him.,""1, 2, S!"",We actually did all these little radio-controlled faces that,kind of (shrieking) and moved around,and screamed and stuff.,(laughing) I remember the little stubby hands coming in,and grabbing stuff and grabbing his head and,it was so goofy and looked so silly when we were doing it.,Steve Johnson built this enormous,,gigantic Freddy Krueger chest and all these,nude people were all painted up and pressing through,this dental dam chest, and I just thought,thatwas so cool.,You go on the set one day and there's, like,,a bunch of girls walking around topless.,It's very important, symbolically, for this thing,and you're bare, you're naked.,So I got them to take their clothes off,and then I had these girls pressing,themselves against the chest.,And I was like, ""This is genius. Every teenage boy,is going to love this."",""Linnea, push out! Push your chest out, Linnea!"",They were shooting this piece,and people are pressing on it, you know,,and pushing through it,and I don't think it was mounted as,stable as they had requested and,up on top was this little Japanese woman, Michiko.,You know something went a little bit wrong and,the whole thing came tumbling dovm.,""Oh no!"",You know, crew members are falling from the rafters.,Here's poor little Michiko crushed by a,giant Freddy Krueger chest.,There was, in general, on the set an aura of panic.,Bob Shaye was sure that he had made the wrong choice,,all through the production, so he would come to the set,and look around and had this really grumpy expression,on his face and this really sort of suspicious look, like,,""This Finnish guy has no idea what he is doing."",No one wants Bob on set.,Renny being the worst. Renny being,,""You take care of it, Rachel! You take care ofhim!"" (laughing),And I would try to work hard and come up with great ideas and,win him over, but I couldn't. He pretty much never,spoke to me during the WhOIE production, except, like,,grunting and looking really unhappy.,Nightmare 4's success would ultimately,be left up to audiences and the response,to the film's release on August 19, 1988,was a surprise to everyone.,Pretty much all I could read was, like,,great reviews.,They found all kinds of hidden meanings in the movie that,I didn't even know the movie had and,I was completely blovm away.,That was the last thing I expected.,It was the biggest,of all of them. It far out-grossed anything.,And then, eventually, the movie made about $50 million,dollars in domestic box office,,which was at the time, the most successful,independent movie ever made.,He delivered a great film, in my opinion,,he did a really good job.,Ren ny Harlin I thought was a very talented director.,It's a tough thing to make fresh and he did.,Bob Sh aye called me,opening day and called me and said,,""You know, I have a habit of taking a limo,and driving around, going to different theaters,and looking at the reactions of the audience.,Would you like to join me?"",And we start driving around going to these theaters,and there's lines around the block.,I said to Bob, I said, ""I gotta call my mom."",Because my mom in Finland had been worried,to death now for three years. Most months I didn't,even have money to call my mom and,she didn't knowmmat was going on with me.,And I called his mother and told her in Swedish,what a great guy her son was.,And my mother is like, ""I'm talking to the head of,the studio and he's telling that my son is a genius,and he's made the biggest hit of the company."",At the time that ""Nightmare 4"" came out,,I think it was probably, in a strange way, the hippest,,deconstructed,,kind of MTV film made.,Over that weekend my life changed completely.,And the first phone call I got on Monday in my ﬂeabag hotel,,I thought somebody was pulling a prank on me when,the manager called my room and said,,""I have Mr. Spielberg on the line."",And that was the first call on Monday.,Just a struggling loser like the rest ofus,in Hollywood and within a year he was directing,""Die Hard 2"" and hanging out with Sylvester Stallone.,It's one of those crazy things in Hollywood.,You just never know who's gonna become huge.,It wasn't long before other studios tried,to cash in on the Freddy phenomenon.,Even Bollywood got into the act.,By now, there's Johnny Carson jokes,,there's political cartoons of Freddy,,Freddy's in the funny papers,,Tom Hanks is making Freddy jokes in movies.,""It's 'Nightmare on Elm Street,' and that,would make him Freddy Krueger."",Anything that's bad is,""A Nightmare in the National League,"",""ANightmare in the NFL,"",""A Nightmare in the N BA,"",it's ""A Nightmare in Iraq."",""When you take a walk down our opposition's memory lane, it starts,to look like ""Nightmare on Elm Street."" (laughing audience),We were so pan of the vernacular.,Everything - from the beginning of the fact that it could be,made into a sequel to the merchandising -,were things that never, ever occurred to me.,It was interesting to see all the Freddy stuff,,all the merchandise, you know, 'cause,it was a million toys.,The Freddy gloves, the hat.,The early merchandising,they just thought toys,they just went for kids.,A misconceived idea, incidentally, a Freddy doll.,'(cackling Freddy doll)',(laughing),He became kind of,the ultimate cuddly toy to have next to you.,He became cool.,I'm like, ""Okay, I made it!"",""I'm an action figure!"",Nobody ever takes them out of,their packages anyway,,so they're all hanging up on people's walls.,""We've got 12 of these Wall O'ffect Freddy Faces,,12 Deluxe Freddy Masks and,12 Screaming Freddy Chests of Souls."",There were watches, jewelry.,Freddy Krueger pillowcases.,At one point,,some company even made Freddy pajamas for little kids,,which, considering Freddy started out as a child molester...,""Kids, go put on your Charles Manson pajamas on,before you go to bed."" Kind of the same thing, you know.,The strangest piece of Freddy merchandise was,Valium in St. Petersburg.,It said in Cyrillic, ""Take one and he will come for you."",Unlicensed, I'm sure. Tough luck, New Line.,I think there was a point mmere,I thought there was a little bit,too much Freddy out there in pop culture.,It seemed like, for a certain amount of time,,people just couldn't get enough of the character.,One of the nice things is Robert is,a loveable ham and,he was just into all of it.,""I'm Freddy, and this is for you."",(laughing maniacally),You could see the twinkle,in his eye when he gets underneath,all that makeup and -- be it,rapping with the Fat Boys,,""It's time for Freddy."",or selling his own 900 number,,""Freddy Krueger is just a phone call away."",-- he's having the time of his life.,You suddenly become woven into Americana,then and you become legendary.,When you travel the globe,and you say ""Freddy Krueger"",people know who you are talking about.,By the time it got to television, (laughing),it was so much like, ""Ah, they're going to drag this,for every possible venue they can."",We said, ""You know,,maybe we can turn this into,a syndicated television show."",The show that wound up being,""Nightmare on Elm Street: Freddy's Nightmares."",It was going to really be this novel approach to television.,This was the promise I was told.,That we were gonna be on late at night and,we could be dark and we could really push the envelope.,This show gave a lot of sort of up-and-comers a chance,to, you know, to get a start.,Anybody who wanted to direct one, could direct one, anybody who wanted to be in,one, could be in one, (laughing) anyone who wanted to write one, could write one.,They had a guest star every single week.,Brad Pitt's in there,,Mariska Hargitay.,I got to decapitate Lori Petty.,Not many people have that on their resume,and I'm proud of it.,It was interesting having done a ""Friday the 13th"",TV series and then,a ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" TV series.,Both things really didn't represent,what the movie franchises were.,""Freddy's Nightmares"" as a concept,was always anthological,and to have him introduced,,he was the Cryptkeeper,,he was Alfred Hitchcock,,he was Rod Sening.,We were going to call ourselves, like,,a dark, violent ""Twilight Zone"" with Freddy as a sort of,host and,participant.,I thinkthey basically had him in for, you know,,one day, two days orvmatever,,and did all those things,so he didn't have to go in and out of the makeup.,He was only in the wrap-arounds really to my episode,,but they also asked me to do two of the other wrap-arounds,aside from my show.,And those were getting shot at the same time,you were doing your episodes, so you would, literally,,run to another set, which was not in the same building,,do the stuff with Robert Englund,,and as soon as you yell ""Cut!"" you ran back and,did your other shot on the other stage.,So, it was crazy. (laughing),""Freddy's Nightmares"" -- certainly a nightmare,in many respects.,In a way it was like film school because I learned,how to really be well prepared when you came on to the set,because you were doomed otherwise. (laughing),The only thing I could remember about the series,was it was so cheap.,Cheap, cheap, cheap. (laughing),""No one's perfect, bubble head."",The budgets were quite low and,they went lower as time went on.,I would say by the tenth one they were,pretty miserable and I stopped paying attention.,They really didn't care about the show,,it was just a cash cow, and so we just ran amok.,I mean, we'd do,whatever it was we wanted to do.,""Action! "" "" B len d-o-m ati c ! ! "" (laughing maniacaffy),All of the early episodes,were originally intended to be,two half hours that were vaguely linked.,And I would say the first five or six episodes,are pretty good.,In fact, I play significantly in one of them.,If you ever see the Pilot for ""Freddy's Nightmares"",you'll knowmmat the show is supposed to be.,The ""No More Mr. Nice Guy"" episode of,""Freddy's Nightmares"" was great because,it was the backstory,of Freddy Kru eger. It's the history of how,Freddy became Freddy.,Tobe Hooper did the Pilot.,He's one of my favorite directors, and people,,in Hollywood.,And Tobe did this dark, wonderful Pilot.,""Springwoorfs nightmares are just beginning."",My daughter at that time was 15 years old, or something like,that, and she had just had a birthday and I got,Robert to wish her ""Happy Birthday"" on camera.,""Happy Birthday, Robin. What are you, 15?"",She was like the star of her school, you know.,""Bet you wish you had a leamefs permit, or better yet,,a drivers license.,Too bad you're not going to see Sweet 16, bitch!"" (evil laugh),We really crossed the boundaries quite often in terms of,what was acceptable on commercial television.,""Freddy's Nightmares"" was very politically incorrect.,That was pan of the fun of it.,""Yes-haw! Ride 'em, cowboy!',""You got any saddle sores yet?"",You could go places that no other show,would let you go.,There are scenes of relatively,graphic sex and violence.,We did shoot a lot of extra footage,,so to speak, (laughing),and we'd just go, ""Yeah, let's have her naked in this shot,"",or something like that. (laughing),Knowing full well none of this would wind up in the show.,(laughing) Or we'd have some bloodbath knowing it,was gonna get cut anyway, so we'djust do it.,There was lots of that stuff, I mean,,one of the ones I directed,had like a full Peckinpah,male-on-female,violent sequence.,Because it was syndicated it played at different times,in different markets and each of the stations could,put it on whenever they unwanted to.,But what happened was they put us on at,4 and 5, 6 o'clock in the afternoon in the Bible Belt,and there was all this reaction and complaining.,The network clamps down heavily on censorship issues.,The ""Safe Sex"" episode, which was the last episode,they bought for the first season,,they said, ""Cut out eight minutes."",""'l'lme for the Big Bang, Cherry Bomb!"" (kissing),It really was not great television.,I can't bear to watch them now because,they're just so wracked.,""How 'bout I make you a Bloody Harry?"",(screaming),It was fun. It was fun to do. (laughing),It has not stood the test of time.,I blame, to some extent, the quality of the,production that really hastened its demise.,Our crew from ""Freddy's Nightmares,"",when we were canceled,,went over and took over ""Tales from the Crypt"",and single-handedly brought dovm,the budget of that show,so that it was manageable, or that show,would have been long gone, too.,(laughing),(laughing),After the stellar box office success of ""Dream Master“,and with the series at the height of its popularity,,New Line Cinema decided the time had come to tackle,deeper, more mature themes.,Freddy would become a father.,The story for ""Nightmare 5"" was,controversial with some people.,I really think that I came up with the story. (laughing),Because I was a new mother and I was consumed,by my child who could very possibly have been the devil,,he had ""Omen"" type qualities. (laughing),I mean, the target audience was originally teenagers,and to scare the holy bejesus out of them and,that teenage audience was now growing up.,And I remember stressing that during,the whole creation of the script.,In the late '80s, early '90s there was,a minor movement in horror.,This kind of hardcore, unbridled,,rock 'n' roll horror fiction.,We were radical, troublemaking horror writers,who all emerged at right about the same time.,Splatterpunk writing had a direct influence on,how the movie fianchises were going.,Basically, as I understand it with ""Nightmare 5,"",there was a,Splatterpunk cattle call, vi/nere every horror writer,who was working in that milieu got contacted,by New Line going, ""Pitch us."",Mike DeLuca, then a,development guy at New Line,,called me in to ask me if I'd be interested in writing,and I went in and wrote, gave them a treatment called,""Freddy Rules."" It posited the existence of a dream reality,location,called ""The Coma Pit."" It's the one place Freddy's afraid of.,And I was the only person in Hollywood without,a script in their back pocket, so I did not get the job.,DeLuca was a huge fan of ""The Light at the End."",That was the first novel that Craig and I wrote,,which was this punk vampire in the subways,of New York, and he was always a fan of this thing.,And out of all the guys that pitched,,Craig and I were the ones that won.,I thought it needed to have those themes,of abortion and birth and motherhood.,These were the elements all coming together,with Alice dreaming her baby's dreams, seeing,Freddy leak into them and then going into Freddy's dreams,,in the unconscious, to find out what made him a monster.,We wrote what we thought was a pretty solid first drafi.,They said, ""Well, you know,,you wrote a ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movie like,a Stanley Kubrick would do it."" And then we said,,""Yeah, cool, huh?"" And they said, ""No."",And our ass was out the door.,For ""Nightmare 3"" I had pitched them Freddy as a baby.,And I went in - one of the executives was pregnant at the time -,and I was, literally, picturing, ""Picture the claws clawing their,way out."" And, no one liked my idea. (laughing),So then I got a call for ""Nightmare 5"" and,when they came to me they said,,""Remember wnen you wanted Freddy to have a baby?,Well, we like that idea now.,What if Alice was the mom?"",Without an approved, finished script in hand and with,a looming release date on the calendar, New Line sought out,the next hungry filmmaker who could deliver,a visually stunning ""Nightmare"" on budget and on schedule.,Stephen Hopkins, who was our director, was terrific.,He had really come from,the an direction world.,He was just so visual.,I guess they'd been seeing a bunch of different people,,but I did big storyboards, I had a lot of ideas about, you know,,the three different scripts they had sent to me.,And Stephen was telling me some ideas and,he started to doodle,,like a cartoon, like a graphic novel.,It was like, ""Well, this guy's great."",Stephen was a big comic book buff.,He has tens of thousands of comic books.,Nice English guy, we got along very well,,we were good friends.,Bob was very determined to make this one,,back to being, you know, more serious and creepy, I think.,The idea was to make Freddy scary again because,at this particular point he was definitely in danger of,turning into like a game show host or a breakfast cereal mascot,,which is, of course, what happened.,I got the job on Valentine's Day,and it was out in 3000 cinemas in August.,I think we only had like 4 weeks prep for this film.,I remember, ""Nightmare on Elm Street Part 5"",I can't believe they're gettin,' it's so quick.,I mean, they did rush it.,The script wasn't really a complete script,and in the end, I think, Mike DeLuca and I,sort of just got all the different pages and put them into shape.,Basically it came dovm to,Alice is pregnant and,she's gonna give birth to Freddy,,so how was this going to play.,We had to make up a set of rules,for what he was doing to get himself into the real wand,,which may be a little muddy in the movie,,but it was essentially,,get all four of her friends' souls and then get them,into the baby.,Alice,,well, she was an important figure.,The story certainly wasn't finished in the fourth one.,I felt a lot more confident just from my experience,from doing ""4"" and doing a feature film.,The fact that they even called me back, I was super happy.,I was like, ""Yes! They called me back to do another one?"",And I was like, ""Lucky. Phew!"",""Through the sm/ining crowd we see Alice,standing with Yvonne, a very grounded black girl."",I thought it was really interesting when I played this character,because you don't always agree with your friends.,""Why don't you take off?"",Hey, you know, sometimes you tell your friend,,""You're full of shit."",Kelly Jo, she rocked.,She was a real firebrand.,""Mark, good-looking, though considerably off-th e-wall, steps into,shot holding a small sketchpad and a large, excessive lollipop."",I actually would have made the character darker.,I wanted him to be a bit more goth,,I wantedjet black hair and like bone shins,,but I got blond hair instead and,shins that looked better on camera, I guess.,It was hard to find the right actor for Joe's part,,the comic book artist.,The Mark characterwas Stephen's idea,,and it was based on Stephen, I would say.,He's a comic book guy.,It was my job to fall in love with Erika,and that wasn't hard.,""Pan over to Greta and her mother standing,at the edge of the group. Greta is living proof of,what God can create when he's having a good day."",I remember that Stephen Hopkins told me that he,chose me because I wasn't afraid to get really ugly. (laughing),And I guess a lot of girls were concerned with that,and they didn't really want to go that far,,but I did.,Erika was just gorgeous,,she was the funniest one, I think, of the lot.,We didn't really have a bad apple in the bunch.,I think everybody was pretty game for,whatever they could do.,Inspired by the traditions of gothic horror,,the cast and crew of ""The Dream Child"",set out to delve even further into the origins of Freddy's evil.,I thinkthe dark, gothic thing was partly me because,I remember Bob Shaye kept on saying, you know,,""Every time he hires Europeans,gargoyles end up on top of buildings,"",and all that kind of stuff. (laughing),I also had my most thrilling experience on,You were going to see who Freddy's father was,in the asylum and it was Robert Englund without makeup,,with my hair all greased back to show my bald spot.,I play Amanda Krueger,,the nurse who gets locked into the asylum.,It was a dream sequence.,'Hove the sort of Roger German, you know,',huge,,just the way the asylum looks.,And I got locked in a room and they'd gotten,every performance art actor,where they all got to do their crazy,,psycho snake pit, ""Cuckoo's Nest"" thing.,What you see is what you get, I mean,,it was a big room.,Hundreds of men walking around, acting crazy.,It got a little hinky, 'cause those actors,they got a little, you know,,it was like a mob.,And when they said, ""Roll,"" on that,I was like, ""Oh my gosh."",Yeah, I was really fighting the ﬂow for a while,with those guys, 'cause not all of them were film actors,and they wouldn't hold back.,Like, ""This is scary, this is really scary."",But it's a very effective sequence,and it looks like a trillion bucks.,The idea of a thousand maniacs (laughing),raping a nun, that's always good stuff.,On ""Elm Street 5,"" the changes,on Freddy were to make him a little more,aged,and a little more weathered.,They brought David Miller back because,they wanted to refine the makeup,,make it easier, make it simpler.,I just felt - and I don't knowvimat the limitations were,,maybe it was time, maybe it was money --,that the makeup for ""Pan 5"" was nowhere as,refined as the one that Kevin Yagher did.,Freddy gets born in that crazy birth sequence, (laughing),he comes shooting out like the ""Alien"" out of her vagina,and runs all over the place. (laughing),But it was quite disgusting, too.,We made a little puppet,,it was a little foam rubber puppet,and it had mechanics in the eyes and mouth.,I got to play with him off set,and I was making him do this.,That was kind of when we were,at the height of the latex prosthetic,monster innovation,period, right in the heartbeat before CGI.,It was a little challenging because,he had to go from being newborn,little baby,,all the way up 'til the final Freddy look.,We actually had a small person,for Freddy to make the set look bigger as the altar,rose out of the thing.,In the church scene,where I encounter Freddy,and I tell him that his birth was the,curse on the mmole of humanity,,""I will not allow it to happen again."",It was also very upsetting as a mother, 'cause Freddy curses.,""We'll see, bitch."",I'm his mom and I just didn't think that was very nice.,There was exactly one line of our dialogue lefi in the film,,""W5 a boy!"",but it's also the one they used,for the poster, so that worked out okay.,""Jacob, a boy of about six or seven years,stands there, watching Alice. He's frail. Other worldly.,Not ghost-like, but possessing a strange, transcendent quality."",The first day, admittedly, I was scared because,Robert's there and he's on set,,automatically looks over,(laughing) and he points at me and he walks,towards me, and I almost took a dump at that point.,The kid is terrific, he'sjust wonderful.,He'd gone through quite a diff cult period,of his life during that film.,My dad passed away in real life.,He was my hero and I loved him and it was really great,to get to work, you know, and kind of forget about it,and be in a real state of imagination,,which is what that set was.,Amid constant script changes and a rushed production,schedule, the cast and crew of ""Nightmare 5"",were left to wonder how, or even if, the finished film would play.,Now ""Nightmare 5"" is shooting,,having gone through all of these other writers,,they bring it back to me --,the movie that I couldn't get hired to write -,they brought it back to me for dialogue polish.,I remember the script was changing,as we were going through it.,We were just racing to do it, and I mean,,I didn't really have much time to miss things that weren't there.,L, eventually, just stopped trying to memorize scenes,because I knew they'd be different the next day.,We would just put together sequences and,solve problems with storyboard ideas,when we couldn't figure out what to do.,He would sit while were doing the scene, literally, and go,,""it'll look like this,"" you know, and draw the picture.,There wasn't always a lot of direction happening.,Stephen was spread really thin and, he said at one point,,""You're gonna pretty much have to,direct yourself in these scenes."",We were at an old, like I think it was a Spaghetti Factory,or something like that, where they made noodles.,And there were sets,everywhere.,We'd have to shush people because they were,trying to build while we were shooting.,There were all these different levels there,and he'd be running up and down stairs,to all the different locations.,As I'm talking about it, I can't believe we actually did,all this stuff. I mean, I wouldn't even attempt it now.,If someone showed you a schedule to try and attempt to do,all these physical effects or something, you'd just laugh.,""This boy feels the need for speed."",I was the first one to die in,but it was a cool death scene.,They were working with special effects to build,a running motorcycle that looked like it had been beat to hell.,Every time he was getting stabbed by,something from the motorcycle,,it was starting to convert him into the iron man.,And, you know, I took a lot of inﬂuence from,Giger, I think, at the time, you know,,and a couple other great artists.,It was pretty fun to work with all that stuff and,make it look the way it did, because even today,people are like, ""Wow."",Right on camera it was really good because,you could see the stuff,moving under the skin.,A lot of it was done in reverse,,you know, he had prosthetics put underneath the skin,,which would pull out.,We did tests and tests and tests.,We started with the hypodermics,then we injected this chemical into it.,“Oh, nice.“ ""Bkchin."" “Cool?,The biggest thing, though,,was of course the suit. We had to,build the suit -- boom -- ground up.,We didn't have time to do castings, molds.,The stunt driver was going to be wearing it.,He came over at least ten times to do fittings,and we actually had Dan wear the head one time for,a close-up of just his eyes.,The end of the scene, they put me inside,a cab of a truck with all this makeup, a thing on my eye,and this whole neck piece and I look just wrecked.,And I have a line where I'm like, ""Hey, Alice."",""Want to make babies?"",People were pulling over and then I stepped out,and they're like, ""Oh my God."" (laughing),And we're like, ""No, it's a movie, it's a movie."",But it looked so real and it was pretty fun.,It was like the best,Halloween costume I've ever had.,I was devastated,when I found out they were cutting it dovm.,I've seen the uncut version and the cut version,,and the cut version is just so truncated.,There's a snake hose thing that comes out,of the exhaust pipe,and it stabs the back of his calf. It's like,,everything is just about to happen,and they cut.,(screaming),We just had to keep on cutting and cutting and cutting.,We were sending it back and forward to the MPAA,,I don't know, twenty times or so.,They cut out half of everything we did.,(screaming),Well, every sequence in that went a lot further.,That's about the best way to describe it.,""Open wide!"",My favorite kill would be Greta.,I think Greta's is really cool.,I really do like that one a lot.,Iwent to high school with a girl named Greta,who became a model and was as anorexic as possible.,Then there was the Monty Python,""Meaning of Life"" eating scene.,It just became almost like a vomiting food fight,,I mean, it really was gross.,All the people at the dinner party were,all laughing and there was something,clownish and weird about it.,I like Greta's mom.,""Don't talk with your mouth full, dear."",Todd Masters did my makeup and,he was fantastic and the first day that,I went in for a makeup test,,we did everything in three stages.,Spent a lot of time with Todd,just moving my mouth around and my jaw to see,what was the most horrifying way to sell it. (laughing),And they wouldn't let me eat.,They told me that I had to have everything,through a straw and we had,long days and I got hungry.,And on, like, the third day or something I just said,,""You know, forget it. I'm gonna eat, I don't care."",They served spaghetti with tomato sauce and,all that tomato sauce was living in the pocket of,my chin and I could smell it all day, it was gross.,And I haven't done heavy prosthetics ever since. (laughing),They actually gave me a copy of Erika's head,that didn't work for them,,and I teased her one time that it was my bath toy,and she kind of freaked out. (laughing),Greta's death was deemed to be,much too foul.,I just know that the scene,was much longer.,Much longer and gorier.,I think Freddy fed herself to herself in the end.,But it just kind of just happened super fast,,the way that it ended up.,I don't think it uvas as good,,it didn't have as much impact.,It's so silly in nature to take it seriously.,I think if we had longer post,we could've fought more about it.,Well, the diving board,scene was complicated because,I had food poisoning.,I was so sick.,I thought I was going to die.,But, you know, the show must go on.,That was, maybe, one of the more complicated ones,because everything about it was stop-motion animation.,We did lots of stop-motion animation in the film.,We had made foam claws, you know,,at the end of the diving board,,that we animated frame by ﬂame.,And then the background was projected.,It was a rear-screen projection.,And that board had to tum into a claw.,And that was a difficult one for Kelly to act,because she had nothing to work with.,I had never done anything with,special effects before.,'Cause it's one thing to see it and you're on the set,and then really come to life and you're seeing it on the film.,There's something, to this day I think,,stop-motion gets that nothing else does.,Digital doesn't really do it,because, in the end, stop-motion just charms you, I think.,I think I was surprised,that that character lived.,(laughing) Freddy did not kill the black girl!,I know that he did in another series,,but he didn't get me.,The ultimate thing that I learned from,this uvhole experience was that,hell is writing for other people.,We had this elaborate sequence,in this artist's loft where all of her artworks came to life,and it uvas really cool. And, eventually, it got turned,,in the subsequent 13 drafts,,into a comic book scene where Freddy's on a skateboard.,',Obviously, the comic book sequence itself,is preposterous.,I think I put the superhero sequences in,'cause I'm a comic book freak.,',I love the reinforcement of the nightmare of the boy,falling into his own cartoons.,Mark being sucked into the comic book,was pretty straighfom/ard and,easy, I think. That was pure animation.,The whole set,km my death scene was painted mack and mite..,You would think it uvas,just color taken out of the film, but no.,When they shot those, they made my face really red,,they got really bright,clothes that I was supposed to be in,,then they keyed everything back.,That was an interesting day. That was, you know,,another actor doing the kind of cartoon Freddy in that.,""Black and White Freddy leaps to his feet!,He is now transformed into Super Freddy."",They took Robert Englund's prosthetics,and fit them on my face,and then put other bits and pieces in there,,'cause I have a bigger head than he has.,The design for the Phantom Prowler had the 9 mm.,Th at was the first time I ever shot,a9mm.,Just having it ""chbk-click"" like that, (gunshot),that was really fun.,That lightning bolt on my shin wasn't,supposed to be there, but,one of the squibs went off and my shirt caught on fire.,For me, I thought that uvas normal.,It's kind of crazy to think of what,I had to do just for those couple lines.,The interesting thing is my death scene,,I had almost nothing to do with it.,We used a replacement animation series,of cut-outs and I animated it,frame by ﬂame,to finish the action.,That's the one that took the slash.,So, it was all done in the camera, basically,,there was no,opticals involved.,I was, I found out aﬂer it happened,,and I saw,Kelly Jo and Lisa crying and,they were shooting the scene after,I'd died and they said,,""You died last night."",And I went, ""Huh? What?"",After we finished, I finish ed the Freddy Krueger stuff,,the next thing you know I was laying in bed with this hot chick.,You see those two bodies at the beginning,when the credits are rolling and they're making love.,That's me.,It was just sort of a supposed, you know,,stylized love sequence we were shooting.,And they said, ""So Michael,,what would you think about doing a love scene?"",I said, ""As Super Freddy?"",And he's buff, (laughing) he's like Lou Ferrigno buff.,So, it's like, however they made it look,,it made me look good.,Thanks, Michael.,Definitely an experience. I'm like, ""Damn, this is Hollywood.,I love it. I want to do this more ofien."",After the loss of Dan and her friends, the stage was now set,for Alice's final showdown with Freddy.,But with the fate of Alice's unbom dream child,hanging in the balance,,the filmmakers were desperate to find,yet another fitting end for Freddy Krueger.,We had no ending to this movie, so,Stephen did some wonderful sketches.,The exorcism sequence is something I wanted to do,'cause I'm a big ""Exorcist"" fan and I stuck it in.,Stephen had such a vision,for that set. it was just in credible.,There was a certain quiet eeriness about it.,It was mind-bending to work out,because you had to really,,really work out in your head not,the reality of what was going on, but,the unreality. So getting all the angles right and stuff.,I had to hang upside down.,It was the single-most diff cult thing,I had to do, though, in any of the movies.,I mean, the moment they said ""Cut"" it was,""Guys, come and lift me up."",But, you know, the blood rushes to your head.,There were so many high points in visual effects,and fantasy in the film, trying to beat them all,at the end was pretty tough.,Mostly, what I remember about ""Nightmare 5"",was that it gave K.N.B. the opportunity to really go nuts.,We basically handled this transformation sequence,where Lisa turns into Freddy and then splits.,I had to wear the Freddy makeup for a mmole day,,about twelve hours.,It was not comfortable. (laughing),And in the final stage,it was Lisa's head and Robert's head, you know,,it's a puppet head in like this,and then pulled apart like this.,It was a challenge wnen Freddy's,coming out of me.,There's a paraplegic gentleman there,and she was having to hang onto him.,They took his, you know, legless torso,and kind of harnessed it to Lisa Wilcox's body.,He was on wires, I mean,,it was just endless.,I don't know, in a million years I wouldnt have thought,they would find a legless actor to do that.,Probably no one's seen anything quite like the final battle of,""Nightmare on Elm Street."" It came out of desperate,script writing at the end, trying to work out,really how to end it and,how to show this kid's anger with Freddy.,I'd say, ""I kill Freddy."",And they'd say, ""How?"" and I'd go,,""How do I describe that?"" I, and literally this is the only way,that a 10- or 11-year-old can describe it,,""I barf on him."",That's what I would say.,I'd say I barf on him and it,goes through him and there's,heads on it.,Having all these creatures,that Freddy had eaten,coming out of his chest on long tendrils,like umbilical chords, which were all,on wires and puppets.,Visually very interesting,,but I think that a lot of those things were,attempts to cover the fact that they had,liposuctioned all the soul and intelligence out of the story.,I don't think you can ever kill Freddy, right?,I mean, you can do what you like,,he doesn't exist, he's a dream.,He was still struggling at the end to get out.,I think it's one of the things about a bad guy:,that is, you can't kill him.,You can make as many as you like.,After four hugely successful ""Nightmares"",,each one having outperformed the last, ""The Dream Child"",was released less than a year after its predecessor,on August 11 , 1989 to generally negative reviews,,becoming the lowest grossing film of the series.,People forget, ""Nightmare on Elm Street 5"",was a success - it was even a hit --,it just wasn't a blockbuster.,I think it came out very quickly after ""4"",and I'm not sure ifthafs, you know,,it's a little less of an event.,Stephen did a lot of wonderful,,disorienting work on that.,I thought he did a wonderful job,,so I wouldn't blame necessarily any of the people,making the movie.,Maybe it was the fact that Freddy was a little played out.,This was a period mmere, fans will tell you,,the series was in decline.,And I tried to live up to the promise that I made to the fans,that we were not going to make a movie that,we did not think was going to be good,,""5"" was arguably lame.,Honestly I wish it was scarier. If it's a series,,you have to work really hard at,keeping it at what it's original roots were,and I think it kind of strayed fiom that.,As an ongoing narrative,of what happens to everybody,on Elm Street,,probably a lesser movie in the canon.,I have to take some of the blame for,""Nightmare 5"" not working,since the story was so much a pan of,what I wanted to say.,They touched on some really serious issues.,Abortion. I mean, that's heavy.,I don't think it was the ""Pro-choice Nightmare."",I think it was like,controversy for controversy's sake,and if we made a political point, fine.,So it's like the ""Juno"" of horror movies. (laughing),I guess she should have aborted him, right?,Maybe it shows abortion's a good thing. (laughing),After the disappointment of ""The Dream Child,"",New Line Cinema found itself at a crossroads with,the future of Freddy Krueger,,prompting their boldest move yet.,Frankly, like with everything in the world,,it's time to move on. I mean, we were,truly running out of good ideas,and I sensed that.,And so they wanted to do, you know,,what could they do to go outwith a bang.,The only way now to revive it after ""5"",hadn't been as successful, is let's make sure that,everyone knew it was the last ""Nightmare."",So it will be the end of Freddy,,we'll kill off Freddy and it's the end.,There was always multiple drafts going,and I had been a big, big fan of a young,New Zealand filmmaker by the name of Peter Jackson,and I'd been talking him up for a while,and I made the case.,Peter and his -- he had a writing partner at that time,named Danny Mulharen --,the two of them wrote a script.,Peter Jackson, actually, he tu med out a draft of ""Elm Street 6."",He was in our ofﬂce typing away at the time.,In his conception Freddy is this kind of.,Tired, decrepit figure. No one takes him,seriously anymore.,In fact, in the ultimate sort of insult,,kids put themselves to sleep with,laughing gas or sleeping pills just so they can go and,kick him and beat on him,,kind of ""Clockwork Orange""-style.,That's what the kids of Elm Street do now,'cause he's such a joke.,And at one point, you know, Freddy sort of manages,to kill one of these kids, you know,,just enough to sort of get some energy back.,And there's a cop. He gets involved in,a fire in a house and is sort of,knocked out and ends up in a coma.,And because he's in the coma,,he's permanently in Freddy-world.,When ""Nightmare 6"" came up I basically said,,""Would you allow me to direct it?"",You've given me these promotions and,they expected me to come back and produce it.,So, Peter and Danny were writing this draft and,DeLuca was also writing a drafi,-- totally different -- and,that draft became ""Freddy's Dead."",I said, ""We shouldn't call it ""Nightmare on Elm Street Part 6,"",we should call it ""Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare,"",which everyone loved.,When the smoke cleared, everyone decided that,DeLuca's script for Rachel was the way to go.,But, you know, the great benefit of,what Peter and Danny did,is through that process of really working at New Line,,that sort of sealed Peters introduction,to Shaye and really laid the foundation for,what would come mu ch later,,which was ""Lord of the Rings."",I was happy to do ""6"" because of Rachel.,Rachel was getting to direct.,I go way back to Roger Corman days with Rachel.,I was very excited to hear she was,directing one of them,,that's, I thought,,""Wow, that's a great story."",Going from sitting in an office desk,to going up to directing one of the films.,For the first time in Elm Street's history,,the story moved from suburban Springwood -,the now abandoned tov\m that Krueger had all but destroyed -,to an inner city shelterv\mere a young man with no memory,,a group of outcast teens and a woman with a secret,,battled Freddy once and for all.,It was very diff cult making the choice,of Shun Greenblatt.,I know that we had the most difficulty casting that pan,because the pan was, you know,,somebody who doesn't have a memory.,""Close up on an eighteen-year-old named John.,His face betrays a map of anxieties, an expression,better suited to a middle-aged neurotic."",You think I'm Freddy's son, that was the big hook.,You know, Freddy had a child, who was he,,how come I'm still alive,all the other kids are dead in Springwood.,Then using that as a catalyst for the story,and for Freddy's character,,to use me as a catalyst,to get out of Springwood,to torment the rest of the world.,The kids I remember because you fall in love with,,you know, you meet all these really interesting kids.,""Carlos, a 16-year-old deaf boy,,""narrates"" like a sports commentator as Tracy,rigorously works out on a punching bag."",I was supposed to play the lead.,I was brought in to play Shun Greenblatfs pan.,When I read the script I just felt,more connected to Carlos.,I immediately clicked with the character,when I read it and that's how I do everything.,I guess you could say, you know,,worked out for me and worked out for him.,Then I got this wonderful actress,,Lezlie Deane, who starred,for me in ""976-EVIL"",New evocative of Jodie Foster 'amen she was young..,""Maggie tums and moves toward,two security guards struggling with,a seventeen-year-old gin named Tracy."",Well I think Rachel read the scene with me and,we actually, you know, got up and started fighting.,We got like a little like, ""yeah, yeah, yeah."",It got aggressive, I mean, you know,in a safe kind ofway, but it was really,,that was actually one of the,funnest interviews I'd ever done before.,Breckin Meyers an amazing guy.,He's come a long way,,he's got a great career going right now.,He's a good guy. Lezlie Deane's one of my best fiiends.,We all stayed connected, which was really cool.,Me and Ricky and Breckin, I mean,,we were like,three peas in a pod.,You couldn't separate us.,Then we got class actors in there,,like Lisa Zane and,Yaphet Kotto giving it gravitas.,""We see that Maggie's a striking woman,,lucky enough to possess that rare combination,of beauty, strength, and confidence."",She was, you know, somehow innerly compelled,to protect children, not knowing what,her own secret was yet.,Lisa Zane I really liked for the pan,because she had this sort of waif-like feel that,you sometimes thought she was quite lost.,You can't keep your eyes off her on the set.,She's like a cat, she's so feline.,And she would throw you offtrack.,You would never believe that she was,Freddy's daughter in some way.,'They said,',""You're his daughter and,you get to kill him."",I was like, ""Wow, alright.,That sounds pretty good.,Can I get that in m/riting?"" (laughing),If you're going to make a story about Freddy's daughter,then you're talking about the mythology to start with,,so that was basically where we,started with the original story ideas.,Rachel, you know, certainly had,a bit of a stain from her work with John Waters,,you know, she has that sensibility.,Let's not be coy about this.,A lot of the crew members were,John Waters crew members.,Our Prop Master at the time was married to Traci Lords. I mean,,you know, it just doesn't get any better than that. (laughing),We set out to have fun on that movie and,there's stuff in that movie that I love.,The first scene,in the airplane, the beautiful,,robust actress to my right,was actually a replacement.,The original person who was supposed to do that role was,the great Divine,,who had passed away,right before we started shooting.,We intentionally made a decision, you know,,to kind of do a Warner Bros. cartoon.,It was just after ""Twin Peaks"" came out and so,there's a huge influence of ""Twin Peaks"" in it,,which is why I went toward humor, quirky humor,more than horror.,It does have a great sight gag, though,,when Freddy drags out,the big can of spikes.,That image in my mind,is like Bugs Bunny doing it in,some old Bugs Bunny cartoon that I loved.,There's a town just full of adults who are sad,because their children are gone and,seeing that carnival scene,with all the adults wandering,around kind of aimlessly and heartbroken.,The carnival scene was so creepy,because there weren't any kids left but us.,And we wanted it to be chock full of cameos.,We got,Tom and Roseanne in that,,who were like the biggest tabloid couple,in the world at that time.,Obviously they weren't doing it for the money,or anything else; they were doing it,because they were a fan of the series,and they were like wanting to be,a pan of the last one.,They just spent most of theirtime,pawing each other.,Dry humping each other,in the makeup trailer, you know. (laughing),And I get kissed on the face,by Roseanne. I mean, that was amazing.,Unfortunately, we ended up keeping her,for like the whole day. I think she thought she'd be in,and out in two hours.,I think it was not a good experience for her.,One of the cool things was the kid Carlos,who wore the hearing aid.,""Aaaaahhh, mommy, not my ear!"",The q-tip from hell.,Any child who's ever had an earache,knows what it's like when somebody comes,towards you with a q-tip.,Canes' death, which I think is probably,the most effective death that I did in ""Freddy's Dead."",We worked our butts off to do that.,I mean, just the makeup every day,,to put the earpiece on that you saw.,You know, I was in four hours of makeup,before we even started shooting.,We were shooting,in this electric plant,that was like the real deal.,We weren't allowed to get any blood in there,,but we had to blow the kid's head up.,It was sort of a ""Scanners"" kind of a deal.,And Bob wanted to do something more,interesting and he had this idea that we could,blow the head up like puzzle pieces.,Weird, organic head parts.,And I really now wish that we had done,something like that, that was more visual,and more interesting.,""Nice hearing from you, Canes."" (laughing),When Breckin did the whole,video game and got sucked into,the TV, and to see that mmole thing on set,,was, you know, was really cool.,Some of the scripts, the writers will indict,a particular teen fad and,Freddy kind of throws it back,at 'em, you know.,I mean, ""Nightmare 6"" when he says,,""Great graphics,"",you know, is like,one of the first gamerjokes ever.,Before the Wii,,Nintendo had this Power Glove,it didn't work at all, but,was this totally groovy looking glove,,and you sort of moved it around like the Wii and said,,""Now I'm playing with power."",And we wanted to use the Power Glove,and Nintendo said, ""No."" And Bob said,,""I don't care that they said no, I'm going to do it anyway."",""Now I'm playing with power."",I really want to do this and it's really a great line, but I think it's,really risky. Bob said, ""I don't care,"" you know, ""whatever."",And we used it and it's great and it sold more Power Gloves,and Nintendo never sued. (laughing),But that's the kind of maverick Bob story that I absolutely love.,One of the more disturbing scenes in the movie,deals with child molestation.,It was really interesting whenever I shot,the scene with my father. I thought to myself,,""God this scene's coming really easy to me,,I don't have to go prepare for it or anything.,And I was like, that's cool in a way because it wasn't,really hard work. And then, maybe three weeks later,after that, I started getting ﬂashes,of being molested. It was weird how,it just sort of pulled that scar back.,Ultimately, in her dream, she sort of realizes her fantasy,and she beats the crap out of this guy,that's been abusing her.,That scene actually changed my life.,It set me on a journey in life,of dealing with things and,dealing with my own fears.,So that scene right there was very poignant.,I think all that father-daughter stufiis nasty and cool,and no one could've come up with that but Rachel.,We were doing the fighting scene,and he went back like that to hit me,with his glove and he actually,hit me.,I had to go to the hospital, get stitches,,get a tetanus shot. So, I have a scar.,So that scar on me I get to look at every day,in the mirror and be reminded of Robert Englund.,Why does Lezlie Deane survive,in that movie? She has no business,surviving in that movie.,Way too many people survive in that movie.,It's ridiculous.,It was important to me to,come up with things that,expanded the mythology.,And I think that was important in order to kill Freddy,,that you had to understand more about his backstory.,And in the original script,,there was this sequence that was described as,""a Mr. Toad's Wild Ride through his psyche,"",and that sounded wild.,I thought it was a really clever way of,making you feel a little sorry for him or,vulnerable for a split second.,I get offers all the time to play villains in,certain things and, at that point, when they said,to play Freddy's father, I said, ""Well,,as long as I don't have to look like Alice Cooper.,If I can look like a hayseed,,really degenerate, old drunk."",I thought I'd play the most disgusting,father I can play.,The coolest thing ever (laughing),was getting Alice Cooper and,the most excited I'd ever seen the crew.,I mean, the crews excited to see,Johnny Depp and all that,,but, the crew having Alice Cooper on set,was like, ""Aaaahhhh!"",I always knew they'd find a way,to blame me for Freddy. (laughing),I got blamed for the Vietnam War, for everything else.,That was very cooLA lot of people wanted,to killAlice Cooper, you know, early on in his career,,and I got to.,Tobe Sexton, who played young Freddy,,really had it dovm.,To play the young version of Freddy Krueger,was something I really took seriously and,something I really took time to, like, work on.,And, actually, I met up with Robert Englund and,found out about the character, how he did the voice,,where he kind of brought it from.,'Cause I thinkthafs kind of the essence of Freddy.,And he really did play it well.,He really had the eyes down on the mmole thing.,There was a secondary scene there,where he goes after me with a blade,,but maybe it was too heavy.,""Go inside honey."",You see Freddy and his daughter,,you see her as a little girl in that creepy backyard.,Working on this film as a little girl, was a really,terrifying experience, to say the least. (laughing),This is supposed to be my father and he's,,you know, brutally murdering,my mother, banging her head against the,house. And seeing that, the tears just kind of,started to ﬂow.,You know, I just went with it and tried,to imagine that that uvas really happening.,For Kruegefis last stand, New Line Cinema tried,to live up to the promise to save the best for last,,employing a gimmick that would make,Freddy's finale trulyjump off the screen.,There's the great thing that Rachel came up with,and for me, it's that wonderful 3-D sequence.,The 3-D element was, again, a gimmick,that we thought could revive the series.,This idea of doing the last ten minutes in 3-D,,which was a tremendously complex technology at that point.,I don't kn ow if the 3-D was really all that effective.,The audience didn't know when,to put on the glasses, they weren't sure,when they were supposed to do it.,When Maggie in the film puts on her 3-D glasses,that's wnen you put on yours, at the very end,""You're going to need these 3-D,glasses to navigate the dreamscape.,Put 'em on now."",It was funny to watch people, like, that didn't know,,were going, ""What's wrong with the screen."",They're like, ""You're supposed to put on the glasses."",They're like, ""Oh, okay."",How about Freddy Kru eger,in IMAX in 3-D like ""Avatar""? (laughing),We actually did some groundbreaking work,at that point on the technology,,but a lot of it didn't work.,She just had mejut some things,toward camera,in an unnatural wvay a few times.,This camera was like huge and,it was like a million dollar camera.,You had to be so precise,in hitting your marks,,otherwise the whole gag wouldn't work.,Rachel was really on the cutting edge and,,you know, the little dream,demons that she wanted in there,they were all CGI,in a time where nobody did CGI.,PM was into he',beginning of the computer technology because,they were working with, they had been working,with Jim Cameron on ""Terminator 2."" And at one point -,and they'll kill me for telling this story -,they sent us a clip from ""Terminator 2"",with our footage of Arnold on the bike.,Jim Cameron would never, like that would be,the end of our career forever, if he ever knew,that one piece of his footage got out by mistake.,I'm like, ""I'm cutting this into my film."" (laughing),I love the fight, the big fight to the death, though.,That was my favorite.,It wasn't clearly,imagined, in terms of what awful things,they'd be doing to each other,,so, a lot of it was sort of,invented there on the set.,And I'm having to hold this, like, pipe bomb,with the sparkles coming out.,And we're gonna blow up Freddy,and his, you know, snot, blood and,bones is gonna be all over your lap.,We blew the shit out of him.,And in Freddy's case I would argue,,at some level, his death,in ""The Dream Master"" and,in ""Dream Warriors"" are,more fitting final deaths,than the death he gets in,Given the fact that we've done,several others alter--,Freddy didn't really die -- it makes,that one look a little more,facetious, I guess, in its execution.,On September 13, 1991, fans swarmed,to the final ""Nightmare"" and the film delivered,a box office take that showed even in death,,there might still be some life left in Freddy.,As one of the publicity stunts for the film,,they created Freddy's funeral.,Freddy's funeral was held,at the Hollywood Forever Cemetary,kind of to put a cap on the whole,wand of Freddy Krueger.,They brought the press in and,we all had to stand over a fake coffin,with Freddy's stuff all around it.,And I had to go and look mournful.,There was a bunch of other cast members from other,movies of the ""Elm Street"" series there.,It was like a big reunion.,It was like a burial, like a real burial deal.,It was a really clever way, once again,,of them promoting the film, of going,,""Guys, this is it. ,This is the last one. He's dead and gone."",Freddy's really dead this time. Not.,I remember seeing on Fifth Avenue a bus rolls by and,there was the poster ""Freddy is Dead,"" and I said,,""Well, it must mean that they've milked the,cow as much as they could,"" you know. (laughing),it wasn't standing very tall itself and then,,so after that, we realized that,we were at the end of the line.,We jumped the shark a little. I'm not going to denythat.,But we wanted to. We wanted to do the movie we made.,""I'll get you, my pretty!"",""And you're little dog, too!"",But it may have been a mistake,to take it so humorous. I think,we shouldve gone from the humor into something,that was more scary.,I think because we thought it was gonna be,the last one, I think it was okay to kind of deconstruct,and self-destruct.,I told everyone it was going to be the last one, of course,,but I didn't know. (laughing),""Freddy's dead."",""Is there any chance he's going to be coming back?"",No.,No, no, no.,No, no, no.,No.,'(Freddys evil laughter)','(Freddys evil laughter)',Now that Freddy was dead and buried,and with the tenth anniversary of,the original ""Elm Street"" approaching,,the inevitable question was raised:,Could everyone's favorite boogeyman be resurrected again?,The answer to that question would,come from Wes Craven himself,,who conceived a radical new approach to the story.,Most people say their sequels are the last sequels,that are going to be made and then they make ten more.,We didn't know that we were going,to be able to work with Wes again.,And the way ""New Nightmare"" happened was,I got a call from Bob Shaye out of the blue.,And, to his credit, he said,,""I've heard some interviews with you saying you felt you,didn't get a fair shake and I'd like to try to make that better."",And he did. He went back,and gave me retroactive cuts in sequels and he,also gave me a little bit of the merchandising, and so forth.,Wes and I had ironed out our differences,and I was anxious to do something with Wes.,And he said, ""Look,,we killed Freddy, we admit it. We said he was dead forever,,but we thought maybe there's one more film there."",Wes has to come back and answer his critics,and finally put the nail in the coffin, and,apologize a little bit for ""Freddy's Dead."",I went off and looked at all the other films and said,,I don't know how I can make any sense of it.,And then it kind of jumped the shark and thought,,I'll do it about all the different people who,participated in the first one.,There was the idea, well, Robert's not Freddy, you know,,Freddy is Freddy. Freddy is an entity unto itself,,that is now out of control and, once again,,it is allowed to be terrifying.,""Miss me?"",Because there was no place else logically,to go that was original and suddenly it was like,,""Wait a minute. We can do this,and make some interesting comments."",Bringing a menace into the real world,from your imagination and having,that menace not go away,,is a terrific idea.,It was so special and unique that it was,worth reviving the whole series.,I was very consciously taking the reality of the first film,and bringing it over into ""real life"" in a way,that it was always quoting the original.,(screaming),Well, it was really cool to see my name in a script.,But then after I digested the uvhole idea, then I thought,,""Well, you know, average people are going to think that this is,really about me and this is my story or something like that."",Heather had gone on and done a television series,,""Just the Ten of Us,"",which was very, very sort of mom-and-apple-pie-ish.,Just by coincidence -- and it wasn't planned,on the pan of the producers or anything -,three of us had been on,""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movies.,So it was definitely a running inside joke on the set.,This looks like something out of ""Nightmare on Elm Street"",I still get all of these letters from people,with this fascination of the Lubbock babes from,""Just the Ten of Us"" all being Freddy Krueger,you know, victims.,As it turns out, a stalker that had started, you know,,calling Heather at all odd hours and,threatening her life,,turned out to be a fan who was ticked off,because the series had been stopped.,And, as a result, I ended up moving to London,for a couple, maybe five months just getting axnray from it all.,And it struck me as such an incredible irony,that everybody had been telling me,my mmole career that, ""What you're writing is bad,and it's going to make people want,to go out and kill somebody."",And it was afan of this,very bland show that actually,tumed out to be threatening.,And so this idea,,I think it was maybe some food,for Wes' thought process.,Wes came to me and said he had been,talking to Heather a little bit about how,if he can delve into her private life,and put some of it on the screen,and would I mind if he screwed around,with me a little bit.,There was a theme of how this actual movie,we had all participated in had kind of,haunted our lives and, in a sense, made it,like we could not be something,totally different from that film ever.,So I said, ""Yeah, count me in,"",you know, ""I'm on board."",And then I saw the script and I loved it.,I pitched that to Bob and,I remember just thinking and saying,,""And Bob, you'll have a big scene."",(laughing) He says, ""Ah, I kind of like that."",I don't think I did a particularly good job,,but it was okay.,""Oh come on, Heather, kids love horror."",It was kind of like a valentine to,the fans.,And, at the sametime,,it was a great reunion for us.,And also I think we all got to go,,""What have we done?"",It was like everybody that worked on the first one,had come back and it was just,interesting to see how they'd grown,and how their careers had changed.,Coming back to work with Wes is always a treat.,I came back, not as a teacher, but as a nurse,,so, but, it was still one of those generic public servants.,(laughing),John Saxon had renaissanced, yet again.,This guy's the guy that's worked with,everybody from Elvis to Quentin Tarantino and Robert Redford,and Bruce Lee and Freddy Krueger and everybody else.,I suppose I imagined it might be the last.,It sounded like a fin ale.,All the other directors had been first-timers,and they had to be,helped through a little bit, but,Wes was, by then, the master.,It was a very pleasant film. I remember,how fun it was and what a sense of,love there was on the set.,Not to be mushy, but just everybody,really liked each other and was having,a great time.,'(practical joke, laughter on set)',Heather Langenkamp,playing herself was so,smart and one of her best performances ever.,And she was, you know, a young mother,at the time and so finding all those,elements from her own reality, that she,could bring into the movie, worked so beautifully.,Some of the things that Wes kind of brought in,that were similar, is that I'm married to a makeup artist.,""Chase Porter, good-looking, early 30s, tweaks the levers of a,remote control device."",I was playing Heather's real life husband, David, who was,Wes' special effects guy, who didn't want to play himself,because it would be a curse.,So, I was more concerned about the curse.,When lwent in and met all the real,special effects team that were doing the movie,and I met David, I realized, like, lwasthe least,non-special effects looking guy on the planet. They're like,blue-collar, hardworking,,beard. They all had heavy metal T-shins on,,they all looked like they hadn't slept in about nine years.,I'm like the dorkiest special effects guy ever.,""Behind them, at the edge of the set, Chase's wife,,Heather Langenkamp, 30, dressed in woman's pajamas,,and his son Dylan, 5,,watch from their ch airs."",I remember having a blast on this film.,This was, every day was an adventure.,Who doesn't want to be chased around,by Freddy when they're 7, like, for real.,We got along, you know,,just like mom and son.,And I was, of course, very protective ofhim.,He had some scenes where,he had to really go through,difficult emotional things.,And there was a time when his parents came to me and said,,""We have a way to make him cry and we don't like to do it,too often, but we'll do it."" I said, ""Okay, fine."" And so,the mother lefi the set and the father Whispered in his ear,and said, ""OK, your mothers dead."" (laughing),And after he'd go through some hellacious scene,,his reward was a Happy Meal.,I don't think horror movies or being a kid,in a horror movie is inherently bad or going to do any,psychological damage or anything like that.,All little kids do anyway is play pretend,,so if you can do it professionally, rock it.,""Heather opens the door to Julie, a direct, open-faced,young woman."",Even though most of the people in the film,had been in the original film, I didn't feel at all,like I wasn't a pan of the group,or pan of the ensemble.,In the original script that I read,,Julie, the babysitter, was a pawn of Freddy's.,Julie was the stalker, Julie was the one,harrassing them. Julie, yeah,,she was all those things.,Wes said to all of us that, ""You might be the one,that's causing this,"" and so, but none of us really,,we didn't really need to know that in order to play the part.,I had done a number of films with David Cronenberg:,""Scanners,"" ""Videodrome,"" The Dead Zone,"" ""The Fly."",But Wes has a very narrow mind,,in the sense of this is what's going to scare people,and a broad mind to extract.,There's something that goes on in the,making of a horror film where you're dealing with these things,that in real life are terrifying,and sometimes morbid and horrible,,but by acting it out,you release some sort of childish laughter,,which is totally,contradictory from what you would expect, but it just,makes for a very tight-knit,crew and cast.,As pan ofWes Craven's darker reality-based ""Nightmare,"",Freddy himself would undergo a major reinvention.,It was discussions with Wes,that Freddy was not to be the kind of,wisecracker that he had become.,I wanted it to be something that,was not quite what was in the movie.,He wanted it to be something different,,something new, more bulky, more muscular.,Everything on it was different.,It was supposed to be the real Freddy.,I felt it looked great to have him look that, kind of German,,sleek.,He's not really burned in that one, like, his skin,is split, like you'd see in a real anatomy book.,This was an actual, real hand and,real blades that grew out of his fingertips.,It was a whole different design and,I thought it was kind of an interesting look.,What I found out from Robert was,that the thumb was a little clumsy,to work with when it had a blade on it, but,it looked good.,Sometimes I think it was smart,,sometimes I think it was a mistake.,I don't know. I've gone around and around,with that in my mind over the years.,The opening of ""New Nightmare"",is actually a tribute to Roman Polanski's,""Repulsion."",When the woman first starts to go mad,,the walls of her apartment crack.,Of course, we shot the earthquake scene,where I'm in bed with Chase and,then we're rocked out of bed,by this earthquake,,probably the first or second day.,And then we did have that,very devastating earthquake.,On January 17th was,the big Northridge quake.,A lot of us had close calls.,When we came to the set, the crew,just looked at me like,,""What are you making a date,with the devil or something?"" (laughing),At that point everybody thought,,well, it's game on. We basically,,we've opened Pandora's Box.,This was the reality that was invading our movie.,Fact and fiction were strangely combining.,This is great. We're all gonna die. It's fantastic.,But what was interesting was, Wes was able to,work that into the movie.,We got a secondary crew,and went out and shot second unit,because we're never gonna get,shots like this otherwise.,There were jackets that were given,to the cast and crew that had Freddy on the back.,They had ""7.1"" put in the corner because it,was right after North ridge.,We have the one scene,mmere I go to the TV studio to have the interview,and then Freddy shows up and he's in makeup.,Being on a talk show as Freddy,,you know, really just being a whore,and working the crowd with the Freddy fanatics,,which of course is all true. There really were those things.,Robert Englund and I,did a public appearance together,on a television show in the San Francisco area,and it was about mmether,this kind of movie is bad for children or not.,There were parents in the audience and then kids.,All the kids leapt to their feet and started going,,(chanting) ""Freddy! Freddy!"",And I remember looking at the show host,and the parents and they were all like...,Robert is just like, ""You're all my children,And it was like,,""We've taken over the asylum."",It is that empowerment of,embracing the symbol,of the evil thing in a way that you're in control of it.,What we're doing is good, you know,,because the kids, it was giving them,a sense of empowerment,in a way that I could never have guessed.,I remember that scene is so great,because I'm sitting there in the background, you know,,there's a million fans wanting his autograph,and then, you know,,I'm sitting there looking at my watch, like,,""Can we go yet?"" which is the story of my life. (laughing),When I got sent the first draft,,there were some scenes that aren't in it,,that were never shot.,Rather than Wes being in the house up on the hill,,he showed up in a van driven by, I think,,Michael Barryman from ""The Hills Have Eyes"",and he had cut his own eyelids off,and he was trying to stay awake.,I was constantly on the run from Freddy.,The way to save my life was to write the script.,I remember reading it just going,,""Wow, that's really weird."" (laughing),Of course, I ended up going with,,""I'd rather be in the luxurious house,living like a king. (laughing),And Wes comes off as this kind of creepy,,horror-meister in a way. And then wnen he shows,that the script is actually on his computer,,the exact words we've just spoken one minute earlier,,(whispering) ""What kind of choice?"",""Whether or not you're willing to play Nancy one last time."",those are the moments that make that movie so terrific.,I remember liking very much the scene where,Heathers husband is coming home in the car.,When you think about a Wes Craven movie,,you think, ""Well, how do I die?"",(singing) ""That's me in the corner..."",Son of crooning R.E.M. ""Losing My Religion,"",getting eviscerated.,It was, of course, very violent.,Freddy's claws coming up.,But, the fact that he was a husband and,he had a little child or something,,I felt very touched by that scene.,But the one thing that they did later,When lsawthe movie,,was they did this thing where they did,an insert of me scratching my balls.,We had a ball stand-in for him. (laughing),I just want to say to you, Wes,,that is not how I would scratch my balls, 0k? It's not.,This is how I would scratch my balls.,And, of course, the scenes that followed were the,'cemetery scenes and that was interesting, mo..,Everybody comes to be a mourner.,If you look in the background,,everybody's somehow affiliated with,""Nightmare on Elm Street."",Tuesday Knight was there,,Jsu Garcia.,So it's just a great way to catch up,with people and see how they're all doing.,A warm family farewell,,now it's turned into something horrible.,And that's the nice thing about Wes:,he's not afraid to,create horror in broad daylight.,The park scene is,,for me personally, one of the most,moving scenes because the little boy,climbs the tower, tries to reach to God,and then falls and says,,""God wouldn't take me."",It's one of the more profound moments in humanity,,you know, when one's faith is contradicted by,the events that happen.,They ended up actually getting rid of the park.,We asked them - we have 10 acres out in the desert --,and we said, ""What are you going to do with it?"",and they were going to haul it to the dump.,So we rented the ﬂat bed trucks.,And growing up I've had that park,in my backyard ever since the filming.,There's a lot of ways to bring childhood into,a horror movie that I realized,And one of the ways is to bring an old story,that we all are really familiar with.,""Hansel and Gretel"" was interesting to me,because there's been,a lot written. It's very hard to find Grimm fairytales,in a children's bookstore anymore. (laughing),That was one of the most horrifying child stories.,When you think about the witch fattening up,the little kid inside the cage,,it is absolutely horrifying.,So, that Wes picked that story was perfect.,In a sense, children need literature,to recognize the nightmares that children have.,And then you had all these toys in Dylan's,room that were his protectors.,Rex was my stuffed animal bodyguard,who would keep Freddy at bay,from the bottom of my bed.,Imaginary, although effective.,I was lucky enough to keep,some props fiom the film.,This is Rex. This one is the repaired one,with the claw slashes on it.,It's funny because I have the other copy,of Rex in my house to this day.,And it always kind of takes a tug at my heart because,it's this thing that protects you but also,gets slashed in the process,but can be repaired and that sort of,childhood innocence in the form of a little animal.,My character, she has so much pressure and she's, like,,really kind of not dealing with it that great.,You need a lot of other supporting characters,to lift up the spirit of the movie, to keep it moving.,And so you had Fran Bennett.,Fran Bennett was incredible, she was,definitely our favorite. We loved her performance,and would quote her lines constantly in editorial. (laughing),""Miss Ian gen kamp!,Miss Ian gen ka mp!"",""The man fiom your film?"",Yeah, it was just great fun.,I asked Wes how my name got to be Dr. Heffner.,He named it after somebody in the,Motion Picture Association of America.,""You have let your child see your films, haven't you?"",it was almost me just saying the lines without,adding anything at all, until it came to the glove.,Each time that glove got on my hand, it was like,some electric something happened in my body.,""Cut this evil out of him."",That was like, ""Whoa, man. This is strange."",My favorite scene in the film,was the death of the babysitter,in the hospital when she's dragged around the room.,We, again, had a rotating room.,I'd done something similar,with a 40-foot room,with Jeff Goldblum as ""The Fly."",This time we decided to actually show,Freddy in some of the scenes,dragging her up the wall.,Wes said, ""You have to scream.,It's a horror film, you have to scream."" So when,I'm getting drug up the ceiling,,I had to do a lot of yelling,and it was scary.,That was a particularly hard scene to film.,When they were filming my shot,,there was nobody behind, but they would put a,cross of tape on it and say, ""That's your babysitter,getting killed, you're terrified,,it's horrifying, you need to cry."",(screaming),When we previewed the film, it was amazing,to watch the audience reaction to it and, you know,,just how Heathers finally,taking control of the situation,,but it's too late to save Julie,The fieeway scene was probably, by far,,the most ambitious thing in the film.,We were allowed to have a mile,of this freeway.,And we were out there night after night,after night doing all these,very elaborate, sort of choreographed scenes.,Where Freddy's all lined up at that center median.,We had a stuntman who owned a truck and we,kind of built the sequence around that.,We projected a picture of the truck on a screen,behind me.,Fifty or a hundred takes probably,to get the crouched down,at the exact moment.,We did that and then the next day,I couldn't walk.,In the film it almost looks like I'm,hit by these cars.,They had a big fake claw,,'cause there's a point mmere he picks me up,with it and that was really fun,,'cause they had a harness,,it drops and I think that was,my first stunt I had to do.,In the original script that I read there was,a scene with the claw mobile,,with Freddy behind the mmeel of a giant claw,that was kicking up sparks on the road.,It would have been awesome to see that,,you know, the claw mobile,,but there was no money to do such things.,And everything just gets completely,messed up from then on.,It's this strange, like other-worldly reality,that I enter, once I enter that house.,Dylan leaves for me the pills to follow him,into the netherworld.,The end sequence takes place in kind of hell.,Cynthia Charette had done ""Shocker"" with me and,she designed it based on Etruscan ruins,,kind of being taken dovm to the,essence of where evil would live.,We were working, you know,,in subterranean sets and boiler rooms,with live fire.,And I just rememberwalking around,and shooting tons of photos, you know,,of everything. I'm like, ""This is cool."",And this wall, there's like a,Cerberus stone carving and,this big demon thing.,Weird paintings,and iron rod gates,and weird stuff like that,,the mmole way through.,I'd rather go there than,Chuck E. Cheese any day.,I think Heath er probably,deserved stunt pay,after all the times,she's worked with me.,There's got to be at least one stunt check,from New Line Cinema she didn't get.,We're really hand-to-hand combat.,I mean, it's really fighting and I stick him in the eye,with the eel and then I try to catch him on fire and,then I actually, you know, say,,""Fuck you!"",And I loved that, 'cause Nancyjust,never gets to say that. (laughing),And then he yanks me,by the hair and he throws me up against the wall,,and if you'll notice, right next to my head it says,,""Lust."",At that point, you know, Nancy and Freddy's,relationship always had a sexual,componenLAm I gonna kiss her,or gut her?,You know? it had to be that fine line there.,To me, that is just the embodiment of,our battle through the whole, all the movies.,K.N.B. made a reallly long tongue,that, you know, wraps around my neck and my head.,It's actually, like, my least favorite thing,I've done for ""A Nightmare on Elm Street."",(screaming),We built a big, you know, foam latex,cable-operated tongue and,lubed it up. And, of course, that's always going to,bring about jokes,no matter what. You know, like, ""Hey, ha ha ha."",When you're the only woman there,and men are wrapping, like,,a giant phallic symbol around your head,,(laughing) it really was awful.,I can remember telling, sort of lecturing the crew,,""Come on now, she's a human being and,don't have a laugh at her expense."",There's also a Wnole transformation thing,,'which we got to do a 'make Freddy Kmeger change-o head..,A bunch of crazy stuff in that film.,Well I remember Wes,unwanted to get a real reaction out of,Mike at one point.,And I said, ""Wes, I can scare anybody.,I can scare the biggest grip on this set.,You want me to really tum it up?"" And I did.,And I'm supposed to run up some stairs,,run down some stairs, and he pops up..,They didn't tell me he was,gonna be there to scare me.,Scared the bejesus out of Mike.,I didn't blame it all on Wes. I could have.,""Wes made me do it!"",I totally don't mind now, I get it.,I mean, it was probably good 'cause,they got a good reaction.,The nice thing about that movie is that,my character is really like,Gretel,and my son is Hansel.,We're both just trying to get back,to the normal life that we had before Freddy,started invading our dreams again.,And at the end we come back out of it,and go back to the normal wand.,This is something that's ageless.,That's kind of what I wanted to say,,is that this kind of movie, this kind of story,could be found in ""The Odyssey,"",could be found,in Greek tragedies.,It's the type of story that's been,pan of humanity for millennia.,Hailed by the NewYorkTimes as,,""an ingenious, cathartic exercise in illusion and fear,"",Wes Craven's ""N ew Nightmare"" was released on,October 14, 1994 to glowing reviews but,disappointing box office. However, to many,,Wes Craven's final nod to Freddy,remains a high point in the franchise,To me, it's the end of the ""Nightmare"" series,,you know, despite what all other nonsense,they did after that.,(laughing),But, to me, that really was the finale,and I think Wes wrapped it up quite well.,And, I think, without a doubt, it's my,favorite of the films now. I think it's so smart.,Every time I see it I find something new.,I love what we say about Hollywood and ourselves,When the movie opened I think it,opened opposite ""Pulp Fiction,"" so,""Pulp Fiction"" was obviously a tour de force.,Ithinkthe film kind of got lost a little bit in that,,but thanks to, you know, DVD and everything like that,,it still has a fan base.,That film was very much ahead of it's time.,I think that's one of the reasons why it's had,a pretty good afterlife and pretty good legs.,When we look back, it was actually a relatively,well-reviewed film at the time.,It was almost a little too unique and cerebral.,So, it wasn't so much scary, it was just clever.,It had a lot of story,,a lot of logic, a lot of reason.,And those things aren't necessarily important,to a Friday night crowd of teenagers.,I think it was the precursor to ""Scream."",""New Nightmare"" was made for the people,who made the film, kind of adults.,""Scream"" was made for the audience that,watches the film and those were the central characters.,""Is that the one where the guy,had knives for fingers? Yeah, Freddy Krueger."",And you notice that Wes, a lot of the characters,take a swipe at 'Nightmare on Elm Street."",""It was scary. Well, the first one was but the rest sucked."",She did it with great relish, I noticed as well.,So many years later, it's like,,I'm just philosophical about it,,so I tapped into something. Half of it I was aware of and half-,maybe much more than half-- I wasn't aware of what I had.,And it's just like something you step back and say,,""Wow. I might've started that, but it took on,a Me of its awn?',Fueled by fans' desire to see two titans of terror battle,to the death, ""Freddy vs. Jason"" was a film inspired by,the classic horror match-ups of the '30s and '40s.,""Freddy vs. Jason"" has been incubating since the first,14-year-old boy came up to me after the first,""Nightmare on Elm Street"" and said,,""Dude, you think you could kick Jason's ass?"",Each time I did another ""Friday the 13th"" movie,it was talked about.,Which is that male adolescent fantasy.,It goes back to ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolf man."",This is nothing new.,And then when we finally got to ""Jason Goes to Hell,"",of course, at the end,the hockey mask is on the ground and Freddy's,hand comes out of the ground and grabs the mask,,which, by the my, was my hand.,So, I technically did a shot as Freddy.,There was a problem with it because,we didn't have the rights to ""Jason"" -,that was Paramount. And it took a long time for,Paramount to finally lose their option.,They wanted to distribute the film and,so it was a combination of things.,I never really had any participation after,""New Nightmare"" -- that was kind of,the end of it for me.,There was always this little bit of a conﬂict,in terms of how to,conceive of ""Freddy vs. Jason,"" of how to write,""Freddy vs. Jason,"" how to tell the story.,The problem was, even if you have these,two characters together and they're both box office bofio,,Jason fives in this wand and than',Freddy is over in the dream world.,How do you get those two together,in a way that they can successfully fight each other.,I remember being at New Line during the gestation of,""Freddy vs. Jason"" and it seemed to go on for years,because it did go on for years.,It is, arguably, the single longest developed,project in the history of Hollywood.,I just thought it was always one of those,legend projects, but I didn't realize that,so many people had actually been working on it.,I thinkthere were 13, 14, 15 writers on that script.,Something like 17 or 18 writers.,So many dreams, so many ways that Jason has killed people.,It was a real challenge to try,to kind of reinvigorate everything.,I believe I uvas playing off of a draft they had,,so some of the things in the draft I did were,original, but some were also in,whatever the previous draft was.,The only thing we were given,,was the notion of, that everybody across the board liked,,was the notion of the Freddy cult.,I created the head of a cult of Freddy fanatics,who were called Fred Heads.,And they all wore, like, the striped sweaters and everything.,And that cult was somehow instrumental in the plot,and trying to sort of resurrect Freddy.,Ron Moore, of now ""Battlestar Galactica"" fame, and I,came up with a take.,The O.J. Simpson trial was going on during the time,we wrote it and one of the drafts had this uvhole thing where,Jason actually gets caught and he's actually going to go on trial.,And the main character's the defense lawyer.,I mean there was a lot of weird-ass shit in those screenplays.,One of the highlights was when Freddy Krueger,actually pissed in the Holy Grail. (laughing),I know that there was a boxing scene.,I know there was a hockey scene.,I know that Freddy got beamed as a satellite ray into the sun.,He had to collect thirteen dream demons,or something like that.,Freddy raped Jason's mother or Jason at one point. They had a,love baby, I don't kn ow. Some of th em got a little weird.,You got all these pieces sort of,built on top of each other Wnen,,at the end of the day, I think if you ask,most of the fans, I want to see Freddy,as I know and love him best,,Jason as I know him and love him best and just let these two,sort of forces of nature go head-to-head.,It's Ali vs. Tyson, it's the irresistible force vs. the immovable object,,and let them go. And ultimately, thankfully, it ended up in that place.,I think it was the fact that we didn't change their mythologies.,We came in saying, ""There's a way to really screw this up."",and that's if you start changing who Freddy is,,who Jason is. If you start reinventing their backstory,fans are going to go nuts.,Those guys, ultimately, because they grew up as fans,of both these franchises, got it.,I think what we tried to do, and succeeded in some fronts and didn't,in others, was make them at least truly evil, scary characters again.,Things we always thought about were, what were the fans,going to think and what will Wes Craven think.,And, you know, we just tried to basically, God, not screw it up.,When it finally got together,,we had trouble finding a director, too.,They met with probably 40 directors.,They met with every director you could think of.,We went to one of the executives and said,,""You should really think about this guy Ronny Yu,"",because we were big fans of,""The Bride With White Hair."",We always were pushing for Ronny from day one. We really,liked Ronny. And then, at the beginning, I think he said no.,That first meeting my intention really was to go in,to tell Bob that I don't want to do the movie.,We had a lot of meetings with Ronny.,I remember a meeting at least 5 hours long where,Damian and I were literally acting out the script.,I told him straight away that I'm not a fan of both fianchises,,but he said to me, ""That's great,"",because he wants somebody to come in with a different angle.,At this point we were looking forjourneymen.,I like the guy's cultural inﬂuences,,he's also a nice guythat,I felt like I could get along with, and he got hired.,There was an assistant, a gentleman by the name of,Jeff Katz and I think he's been a great help to me.,When I dropped out of college to intem at New Line,,my real goal was, I need to get on ""Freddy vs. Jason"",before it comes out, because that's like my dream movie,to go make. I grew up on these things.,And when I started writing Bob Shaye as a little kid,,it was built around the idea,that some day I'm going to come out and make,a ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movie.,He is the hardcore audience,,you know, of ""Freddy"" and ""Jason"" and he told me everything.,I was lucky enough to be a 24-year-old kid living the dream.,And to have your first movie you work on be your childhood,dream movie is a pretty cool and surreal experience.,I was very involved once they started developing the idea.,I was in contact with people at New Line.,They were saying, you know, ""We're finally going to do this."",We always assumed that it would be Kane.,I always envisioned him as a Jason,that could beat the shit out of Freddy.,And then they hired a director and then all of a sudden I started,getting the feeling that something was changing.,Immediately we had some casting issues,because before I'm on board,already the studio decided that they want a new Jason,And I was never given any kind of reason.,I mean, I know the thinking there. I think, physically,,they were looking for somebody that was taller.,Could Kane probably have done it? Sure.,But I also do think that you were dealing with the idea that,from a directorial point of view,,they were very clear, they wanted the idea of,one guy big and burly, one guy small and lanky.,I think, that to me, really was the largest piece to that decision.,I said, ""Fine,"" you know, ""this is their call and I'm fine with it."",It was nice to hear that a lot of fans,were not happy withe idea either, but,it was going to be a success to matter mmat,,just because people wanted to see the,two characters together.,The biggest question was, who would win the high stakes,match-up: a maniacal dream stalker or a brutal force of nature?,When I was making ""Bride of Chucky,"",I learned, ""Don't take this too seriously,"" you know,,have fun with the monster. So, I used the same,sort of principle to apply on ""Freddy vs Jason."",Just that little outsideness that Ronny Yu brought to it,,being a Hung Kong director,,really helped it, I think. It's got a terrific cast, you know,,Jason Ritter, Monica Keena,,Kelly Remand,,Katharine Isabelle,from all of the ""Ginger Snap"" films. So, a terrific little cast.,""Lori, 17, pulls a stuffed toy, like a Furby but creepier,,away from her friend Kia.,Lori is an attractive, trusting gin next door."",When I was 8 years old I lived in Brooklyn,and I went dovm the street to my best friend LeeAnn's house,and they were watching ""Nightmare on Elm Street,"",and I thought,,""This is just too terrifying."" I had never seen anything like that,before, I'd never been allowed to watch horror movies before.,I was so traumatized by this movie that I couldn't,,literally, couldn't sleep forweeks,and it changed my physical appearance. At the age of 8,,I lost like 10 pounds. My teachers got so concerned that,they called my mother and said,,""ls there something going on? Is she being abused at home?"",And my mother found a picture of Robert Englund the actor,,and Robert Englund in the Freddy Krueger makeup and,pasted them up near my bedside table.,And every night before I'd go to sleep, literally for like a year,,I would have to look at it and say,,""lt'sjust a movie, it's just a movie. He's not a real guy."",And I rememberthinking,,""I'm gonna grow up one day and I'm gonna be an actress,and I'm never gonna make movies that scare little kids."",Cut to, a couple years later.,I was always joking to her, I said,,""Your scream can break glasses."",(screaming),When I was screaming and hysterical, I really feel that,came from a place that I've repressed for so long that,I was able to tap back into immediately.,She almost, like, lost her voice after the movie.,And I didn't tell Robert this story,until the last day ofﬂlming and he thought,that was just so hysterical.,I was reallly excited to work with Jason Ritter,and he was actually a late addition because, I don't know if,people know this, but,Brad Renfro was originally playing that part of Will.,I was a big fan, I thought he was a really good actor,and we were excited.,You know, rest in peace, Brad Renfro. Brad Renfro,,I think, was, like, one of the more promising,young actors that we'd seen in a while.,As I'm sure everybody knows, he had a lot of personal problems,and those problems became clear when he showed up to the set.,I actually had to screen test with him and they thought,our chemistry was so good together,,that really kind of part of the reason,I ended up being cast was because of Brad.,Suddenly I remember,John Ritter, who worked on ""Bride of Chucky."",And I also then remembered that he has a son,that also is an actor.,I was thrilled with Jason Ritter,,he's one of my favorite people now. It was sad, it was sad,to have to lose one to get the other.,In my ideal wand, there would have been two V\ﬂlls.,You need to have one guy that the audience,should invest a little bit of their emotion.,Person ally, I thought,we should invest a little bit more on Jason.,For me, he's almost like a samurai that went nuts.,You know a samurai is so loyal,and Jason is so loyal to his mother.,We have Freddy here, really tormented him,,humiliated him.,I never asked anybody,to like Freddy,,certainly not to feel sympathetic for Freddy.,Freddy likes his work.,We always saw it as, you know,,Freddy was the psychological manipulator.,I don't think that Wes ever saw this as,a high body count type thing.,Freddy was more cerebral, plot-driven, manipulative.,For us, ""Friday the 13th"" was more fun, bloody,,high body count.,So, in that sense, we tried to stay true,to both characters.,Freddy sort of enlisted Jason to be,his little minion to help him kill people.,One of the funniest things I thought about in that movie,was that, you know, Freddy was about to kill people,and then Jason would kind of circumvent him,,you know, beat him to the punch.,""She's mine! Mine!"",And then it became a competition of them fighting,after the same prey.,And so that's how they became adversaries,,which was kind of cool.,I'm actually the only one that Freddy actually kills,in ""Freddy vs. Jason."",So, I'm a very lucky, lucky, lucky man.,""Mark sits at his desk, going through drawers.,He pulls out a framed black-and-white photo of,him on the shoulders of his older brother Bobby."",The character I play in ""Freddy vs. Jason Bobby,,ends up becoming a tormenter of Mark,,but he's actually his older brother. And,,even though I am Scut Farkus from,""A Christmas Story,"",and I'm kn own as a turd woﬂdwide around Christmas,,I don't think that was a motivating factor,for hiring me as Bobby because you had to have,a lot of sympathy and pathos for Bobby.,That was two of my favorite characters;,we loved that relationship.,There was this kind of unspoken history vi/nere,Mark's brother was, you know, killed at some point by Freddy.,And it really ramped up,the pain that Mark's character felt in losing his older brother,and gave him a lot more momentum and,impetus as to why he reacted the way he did.,And that did just get hacked to shit.,I'm walking through this elaborate bathroom set,and then committing suicide,was a full day and a half of shooting,wearing nothing but what we call in the industry, a ""cock sock."",Shooting the bathroom scene, I had,the prosthetics coming out,,the blood tendrils coming out of my feet,,rooting me to the ﬂoor.,And so, those took like three or four hours to set.,And then we had the other sequence,where I'm walking towards Mark.,This prosthetic has got,all these little air bubbles in it,that expand and contract,and some of them are filled with smoke,and some of them are filled with blood,,some of them are filled with pus.,And right behind me, you've got five special effects guys,on their knees, smoking cigarettes, blowing the smoke,through the tube, pumping these things. (laughing),And on their knees waddling as quietly as they can,and you're trying to be all,sexy and scary, you know, while you do this,monologue towards Brendan,,and you've got five people up your butt.,We shot more with Mark, that dream stuff, that I would,love to see actually go back in at some point on DVD,,that has a little more of Freddy screwing with him,and is a little more,sort of drawn out in the classic Freddy tradition.,It was really cool for me, you know, to be in scenes with Freddy,and have him be doing these very, like, classic things.,Like, he would be stalking me when I was,in the corner in the bathroom,and he'd be taking his claws out and, like,,dragging them dovm my face.,And, you know, I'm trying to act scared, but in my mind,,I'm like,""Oh my God, this is so classic."" Like, ""I can't believe,he's doing this.,He must really like me."",Originally, Brendan was gonna vomit all this stuff.,I can't even remember if it's in the final cut.,When you're working on a Freddy movie,,there's so much going on that you're like,,""Oh, really? We're setting me on fire now?,OK, sweet, nice, good. What's next?,Me getting my face slashed? Awesome. Let's do that."",Brendan Fletcher is a very, a really good actor.,He's got a fantastic range and a lot of passion,and integrity and a pleasure to work with.,Zack Ward is a liar. Absolute liar.,""Dude, that goalie was pissed about something."",The character of Freeburg, I think was,,I don't even know if you would say inspired by,the ""Jay & Silent Bob"" character.,I feel like it was sort of a direct rip off.,It almost takes you out of it because you're like,,""Wait, is that that guyfrom ""Jay & Silent Bob""?,And what is he doing here?"",I mean it was amazing. When they offered this,and I went and I played Freeburg,and it was, like, a lifelong dream come,Wait, I didn't play Freeburg. I wasn't in that movie!,But it's never gonna be the way you picture it, you know.,Stuff gets rewritten and,they change things. I mean, you know, it's an organic thing.,I think most of my regrets about the cuts,are stuff that made the movie illogical.,As a writer, the stuff that drives you crazy, is like,,""Well that doesn't make sense anymore,because you cut this scene."",Or, you know, dialogue that just seems,ridiculous now 'cause it's out of context.,""Freddy died by fire. Jason by water.,How can we use that?"",My philosophy is,everything in the movie,should set up for the end fight.,I finally had dragged Freddy back into reality,,into Camp Crystal Lake,where Jason's there waiting.,And it was a grueler because,,instead of chasing Heather around in her underwear,or lovely Lisa Wilcox in her teddy,,instead I'm rassling with,a 6 foot 7 Canadian who's been in over a hundred movies,and is buff and hard and can drink me under the table.,It was a rough shoot. I did a lot of my stunts.,I think the final battle was a lot of fun.,So over the top,,the violence and everything, that the audience would laugh,at the violence, rather than,really affected by the violence.,I got such a kick out of that because I thought, like,,they finally deserve it and they're,the only two that can torture each other,the way they've been torturing everybody else.,Maybe the thing that I hate the most,is Kelly Rowland's monologue right before she dies.,We didn't write a word of it.,""What kind of faggot runs,around in a Christmas sweater?"",And when I saw it, I mean, it actually really bothered me,that she used that word.,I'm surprised they kept it in.,Interesting enough that nobody, not New Line,,not the studio, nobody sort of picked it out.,What our original idea was,she's talking to Jason and she basically says,the lines that Nancy said in the original ""Nightmare."",""I take back every bit of energy I gave you."",She says, ""I'm no longer afraid of you. I take back all my fear."",And Freddy's behind her and says, ""Wrong one, bitch,"",and that's what kills her because she is,mistaking one mythology for the other.,But, um, the faggot line made it. (laughing),I actually did do a lot of my own stunts to the point where,I uvas like, a little frightened, you know.,There's this one scene where I'm running,out of the burning building,and, like, the mmole dock is about to blow up.,It was only supposed to blow up about,,you know, 30 feet ﬂ'om us,and it ended up blowing up, it like ricocheted.,And everything, all hell broke loose.,(explosion),We were hauling ass to get out of there and then,we just dive right into the water,and I remember aften-vards you could tell,,from the look on the director's face and sort of all,the people in production's face, like,,that something went drastically wrong.,My shoes would get burned and I don't even notice.,Well they just sort of said, ""Okay,,well we got that. Moving on.,That's destroyed. ls everyone okay?"",But it was a great sequence, you know,,at the end, you know. It's all worth it.,The most cathartic part about it,is that I get to cut Freddy's head off.,It was like, ""Fuck you.,Why'd you have to play that guy to traumatize me,for all those years?"",That's my favorite moment I've ever had on film.,Even,They did a couple endings that usually ended up in hell,that was a very sort of classic third act sort of set piece location,,a lot of those eany drafts.,Freddy and Jason were coming at each other,and then just before,chains went into both of them and pulled them apart,and, I believe, Pinhead came out,and said, ""N ow gentlemen,,what seems to be the problem?,"",mmich I thought was hilarious.,That didn't work for a variety of reasons,,not the least ofvmich was that New Line,did not ovm the character.,We have a title name, ""Freddy vs Jason."",I always thought that the ending,should be on these two monsters.,It shouldn't be on any other people.,But somehow the studio thought differently,,and so we shot the ending with a love scene.,I'm about the be de-virginized.,VWI was having sex with Lori for the first time,and hand turns into a glove, which confuses me.,For me, it's a little bit sort of wimpy.,I thinkthey only showed it once and, I mean,,the audience hated it and I hated it, too.,It didn't really make any sense.,Bob came in and says,,""Okay, guys, we have a problem here because,the audience hated the ending. So what are we gonna do?"",And I hate to say, ""I told you so, Bob,"" you know.,I immediately come up with,Jason coming out from the lake.,I remember ""Apocalypse Now,"",Martin Sheen's head coming out from the water.,That is the inspiration, that's,how I got the idea.,And Bob says, ""There'sjust one thing I want to add."",I say, ""What?"" "",""I want Freddyto wink,at the end."" I said, ""Great!"",Nearly two decades in the making, ""Freddy vs. Jason"",finally arrived on August 13, 2003 and fans turned out in droves,making it the highest grossing entry in both the ""Elm Street"",and ""Friday the 13th"" franchises. The film's success proved,that by themselves Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees were,forces to be reckoned with, but together they were unstoppable.,Before the release of the movie we had,this, like, press conference, you know,,in Las Vegas, you know, almost like a boxing match,,like a Rocky boxing match, you know.,""Mama's boy here,he's stupid and he ain't got no style!"" (audience boos),And then they both come out and then,they fight each other.,They smash the table,and smash the chair,and I'm stuck in the middle.,I'm scared. It scared the hell out of me. (laughing),When the movie came out it was the,highest horror opening of all time.,I think it was the highest grossing of the bunch.,I think it opened to $25 million or,something the first weekend.,Like, it was huge.,That's really a fan-inspired film and,that's probably one reason it did $135 million worldwide.,This movie made a lot of money.,So, if you think about it, a lot of people,have seen my bum.,Like a lot.,That performance at the box office was really driven by,convening the non-fans, getting those guys back that,had not seen one of these movies in several years.,There's nothing that brought it up to the,level where you could feel,,this is about some important human issues, aside from,just two men smashing each other.,So, it didn't do it for me.,It's just a fun movie. It's kind of like a big comic book.,Personally,,I just felt that my instinct was right,,even though I don't have that much experience,,you know, with both franchises.,I'm so happy that the audience also endorsed that.,There were some interesting ideas at one time.,There was a, you know,,a ""Freddy vs.Ash vs. Jason"" that was talked about.,At that point we had all pretty much gone with the idea that,it would be fun to go and get a real hero to go against them,and not try to mix the mythology.,I think that Sam Raimi wanted,Bruce Campbell to win,,mmich I thought was a terrific idea.,Making the world safe from sequels, Ash.,But I think that would be even,harder than it was to pull off ""Freddy vs Jason."",As you can see it, it wasn't that easy.,It was debated for a second,,but it was never a serious consideration.,We didn't find the right combination,of elements to make it work.,I think with me, it's about time for ""Freddy Meets Viagra."",Who won,,Jason or Freddy?,It's fair to say it's a draw, ultimately.,They both sort of won.,I think the winners probably Jason Ritter because,he gets to do a love scene with Monica Keena at the end.,I think that if you were a fan of Jason you definitely thought he,won, and if you were a fan of Freddy, he won.,And that really, to me, is actually the perfect ending.,Freddy's winking at the end there, so,,you know, he's still clickin'.,Well, in my mind, not necessarily in,other people's minds, I think it's Freddy.,I think it's Freddy, Freddy, Freddy.,After forty years, the company that started from the trunk of its,founder's car, saw itself at the end of an era.,In 2008 Bob Shaye's mini-major empire was consolidated into,its parent company, Time Wamer.,'Merging with Warner Bros, of course, gave them',almost unlimited resources in terms of financing,,but it also tied their hands in many ways and,already then New Line changed from this really,maverick, independent company that it had been.,By the time we were making ""Nightmare 7,"" New Line,was already, you know they called it ""mini-major,"" it had no,resemblance to an independent film studio whatsoever.,You could never make a film anymore there,for less than 20 or 30 million dollars.,You know, I'm like, ""Don't you understand we made these films,for 5 dollars."",But all the son of small, more interesting stuff got lost,in a bunch of corporate people working within the company.,Bob could no longer say, ""Screw it, this is what I'm doing."",The company was getting unwieldy and,the politics were getting unpleasant.,It was probably time to move on.,When Bob was then forced out of the company,,that was incredibly sad and incredibly shocking.,I still have sad feelings about the tum of events,,but I think, as somebody once said to me,,divorce can also be a good deed.,I was sad, but in a way it felt like, okay, this has been,a blessed run.,And they made some absolutely amazing,,obviously, some phenomenal films within that.,Afier the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy it was,kind of like an epiphany and it may have been,good to go outwith a bang.,And imagine that this guy created this company,from nothing and it became,a billion-dollar-making company winning Oscars.,That's the American Dream, and Bob Shaye and Sara Risher,,they have lived it.,It's, obviously, a sort of triumph of the underdog.,It changed our lives forever.,So, we owe a lot to Freddy Krueger.,Forged with passion, ingenuity and a maverick spirit,,New Line Cinema entered the annals of Hollywood history,as a pioneer in the world of independent filmmaking.,And those who were there tram the beginning,will never forget the house that Freddy built.,Bob Shaye launched some incredible careers.,There was something really special going on during that time.,New Line really was a filmmaker's studio,,because Bob always saw himself as a filmmaker.,Whether you worked in the mail room,,you were an unpaid intern,,wherever you came from, if you had a good idea, they'd use it.,One of the greatest times of my life,,those years that I spent there.,That's what drove us all, was just this excitement,to be working on a, you know, Hollywood film,and I get to be inventive, I get to be creative and,think of things that have never been done before.,I'm very fond of the ""Nightmare"" series and,I love looking back at them and I'm very proud of them.,There's actually so much more in this series than, I think,,even the people who make it sometimes are aware.,They're kind of hallmarks of the era and,,I think, the best ones. Take that, Jason.,I'm even going after Jason 'cause I don't care,,'cause I'm gangster.,It's become pan of, it's pan of my life. There's not a day that I,don't think of ""Nightmare on Elm Street."",I was the boy in school that people threw rocks at, and then,I was the one that ended up on the silver screen.,So, you never know how it's gonna go.,What was once sort of, like,,""Yeah, I was in ""Nightmare on Elm Street 3,"",has tumed into a definite sense of pride about it.,And I think that that's going to live on and on and on.,I have literally met executives,""I'm having a meeting. But I'm a Freddy,fan, you've got to sign this."" I'm like, ""Okay, this is off the chain."",it's still in my life. Look, it's been years and years,and no other movie I did is still in my life like this.,Still, now, I mean, even after all the other work I've done,,it's always, you know, Kristen from ""Nightmare on Elm Street."",You were the guy.,Wow, I was so scared.,That, to me, is, ""Wow, it really meant that much?"",It's incredible how these films have impacted people,who are fans of horror films.,Horror fans are really hardcore and they're loyal.,So, that for me is the greatest part of all of it.,They're just the most rabid, you know,,and they want to know everything.,And, I'm like, (whispering) ""I don't know.,I didn't Write it, I just got killed in it."",lam very proud to be a part of something that became,such an iconic film of its era and,I'm very proud to have been a pan of Wes' vision.,I thinkthis film has its place firmly planted in film history.,I'm proud to be a part of what I think is,probably the best horror film series ever done.,I learned to believe in imagination in films.,I learned that there's a way to do it.,It's such a brilliant, elastic media.,Now I've done it and I began to love it,,you know, I became a fan now.,The best thing that ever happened to me,was ""Nightmare on Elm Street."",It changed my life. It made my career,and pulled me out of poverty,and paved the way for a career that has,lasted now over twenty years.,If New Line is the house that Freddy built, my career is the,career that Freddy certainly launched and built at some level.,And so, what can I say?,I love that crispy, burnt motherfucker. I love him.,Freddy will always be Robert Englund to me and,he just created this persona.,I think if you got the wrong guy under that makeup,it wouldn't have worked at all.,Without Wes Craven and without Robert,I don't think it would have been,,obviously, it wouldn't even have existed, but I think it's just,a testament to their talent that that character became so big.,We only get so many great, classic stones. That's what,separates us fiom the animals, are the stories we tell.,And ""ANightmare on Elm Street"" by Wes Craven,is just a great goddamn story.,I can overemphasize,how important Wes Craven is in my life. I think back,,you know, he's given me this role of a lifetime.,If I never work again, I can kind of die happy,that I played a role that is so important in American cinema.,As Garrett Morris used to say, ""Baseball has been berra, berra,good to me ""Freddy's been very, very good to me and Wes taught me,to respect the genre and I'm glad I listened.,What I say to the fans is thank you.,And I say that to everybody Mo's participated,in making all the films.,There were better ones, there were not so good ones, but,they're all good in and of themselves and I know,everybody broke their back to do the best,that they possibly could.,And so, it was a fantastic experience.,We were able to do what I always like to do,,is to really entertain people.,When I die, it'll be, you know, in my obituary, I'll probably be,best kn own for inventing Freddy Krueger. (laughing),it will be something like that that will,summarize my entire career.,And I think for Robert it will be, it's the man,who played Freddy Krueger.,You know, no matter what else you do in life, it's just one,of those things that a film has it's way with you. (laughing),And now a reading from ""Freddy vs. Jason,"",as the part of Bobby played by Zach Ward,And scene commences.,""Oh, that's right! Everyone forgot.,That's why they weren't afraid anymore."",""Let's kick this motherfuckers ass all over dreamland.,Hey Freddy! Where you at, you bumt faced pussy!"",""I guess I better go gnash my teeth for the paparazzi."",""Hello, baby!"",""How much longer will you go on blaming your dreams,for your own weaknesses?"",Hesse! Jesse?',""Hello, dirtballs."",""You'll need a hallpass."",""Screw your pass!"",""Miss Langenkamp. Miss Langenkamp!"",""I am the wizard master! I am the wizard master!"",""Free me, you idiot, I'm your fucking memory!"",""Hey, up yours with a twirling lawn mower!"",""There's four letters in my name, Rod.,How can there be room on yourjoint for four letters?"",""Hey, yo, needle dick. I bet you're the only male in this school,suffering from penis envy."",""Faster than a bastard maniac!"",""'l'lme to die, scarf ace limp dick!"",""It's super Freddy!"" (laughing maniacally),""Come back to me, Jesse. I love you, come back to me!"",""I'm right here."" ""Oh."" (screaming),""Are you ready for it, boy? You been a waste since,the day I took you in. Now it's time to take your medicine."",""Thank you, sir. May I have another?"",""Jesse, it's okay, it's all over."",""Just step away from her, son,,just like your ass depended upon it."",""Oh great, now it's my dick that's killing me."",""You know, you're one major league hunk."",""Yes, I am one major league hunk."",""Hi, handsome."",THU',""Andale."",""No, mother, you just murdered me.,Take that to your goddamn therapy."",""Somebody please wake me up!"",""Look for me in the tower."",""School's out, Krueger."",""Stay with me, Heather."" (squirting sound) That's the blood,coming out of my eye. (laughing),""What the fuck are you doing in my room, dude?"",""Welcome to my world, bitch!"",""Gin, you better put a lock on that window."",""In my dreams I'm beautiful and bad."",""Rex!"" (screaming),""The deadly dinosaur?"",""Goddamn it, Kristen, you ruin everything!,Every time I bring a man home, you spoil it!"",""The map says we're fucked!"",""It's a goddamn cherry bomb! Jesus, Jesse! What the fuck!"",""I have a feeling we've done this before."",""Cut the evil out of him."",""N000000000000oooooooooooooooooczﬂ!!!!"",""Freddy's dead."",""When that time comes, you're going to have to make a choice,whether you're willing to play Nancy one last time."",""Whatever you do, don't fall asleep.""
